Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt1_01_live_Marcus.wav=So, you want to hear another story, eh? One where the very fate of Pandora hangs in the balance? If not, too bad -- I’m telling you anyway. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt1_01a_live_Marcus.wav=First, there was the Vault -- an alien prison opened with a mystical key. To the warriors who opened it, the vault was just a container of tentacles and disappointment. They vanished into the wastelands, certain that the Vault held no treasure at all.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt1_01b_live_Marcus.wav=They were wrong. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt1_01c_live_Marcus.wav=The vault’s opening triggered the growth of Eridium, a priceless alien element. Soon, the rare and valuable mineral emerged all across Pandora. Its appearance attracted many. Including...the Hyperion corporation.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt1_01d_live_Marcus.wav=They came to Pandora to mine Eridium, and bring order to the savage planet. Through their excavations, Hyperion uncovered evidence of an even greater vault. Their leader vowed to find it -- to use its power to civilize the Borderlands, once and for all.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt1_01e_live_Marcus.wav=But Hyperion weren’t the only ones searching for the next Vault’s alien power. The call of danger and loot is not so easily resisted. Certain warriors came to Pandora in droves to uncover its hidden secrets. Some would call them adventurers. Others call them fools. But I...call them vault hunters.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt1_01f_live_Marcus.wav=Our story begins with them, and with a man named Handsome Jack...
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt2_08_live_Jack.wav=Vault hunters: I need your help.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt2_10_live_Jack.wav=The power inside the next vault could bring peace to Pandora. Only badasses like you could brave the horrors of Pandora and find it...
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt2_11_live_Jack.wav=...Which is why you’ve gotta die.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt2_12_live_Jack.wav=See, I can’t just have some psychopathic murderers getting to the Vault before I do. Don’t get me wrong, it’s cute that you all think you’re the heroes of this little adventure, but -- you’re not. You’re bandits. You’re the bad guys. And I...am the goddamn hero.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt2_13_live_Jack.wav=Welcome to Pandora.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt2_14_live_Jack.wav=(laughs)
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep1_Pt2_15_live_Jack.wav=I can't just have some psychopathic murderers getting to the vault beforeI do. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's cute that you all think you're the heroes of this little adventure, but you're not. I'm the damn hero. (beat.) Welcome to Pandora, kiddos.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_01_live_Roland.wav=If the Angel is lying, we’re going to need another plan to deal with Jack.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_02_live_Lilith.wav=I’ve got two ideas.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_03_live_Roland.wav=Other than ignoring Jack entirely and making out until he decides to kill us.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_04_live_Lilith.wav=...I’ve got one idea.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_05_live_Roland.wav=Would you please focus?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_06_live_Lilith.wav=Really, though -- if we can’t get the vault key, what’s left? Fire our guns into the air and hope a bullet accidentally hits him? 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_07_live_Roland.wav=Evacuation.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_08_live_Lilith.wav=Say again?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_09_live_Roland.wav=We can steal as many Hyperion ships as we can. And we leave Pandora. All of us. For good.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_10_live_Lilith.wav=And do what? 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_11_live_Roland.wav=Keep out of sight. Get as far away from Hyperion’s grip as we can, for as long as we can. It’d be the smart move, tactically.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_12_live_Lilith.wav=Tactically, I'm not running.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_13_live_Roland.wav=You think everyone else in this city deserves to die because of our pride? 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_14_live_Lilith.wav=Scooter might.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_14a_live_Roland .wav=Could you be serious for a second and --
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_14b_live_Lilith.wav=I'm staying, Roland. End of discussion.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt1_15_echo_Roland.wav=I bet your friend Claptrap could get through that Hyperion forcefield. He’s out of date, though -- he’ll need a software upgrade. Mordecai should have what you need; he's camped out near the preserve. Think he needs your help with something.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_01_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Hey, over here. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_01a_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Hey, I heard about Sanctuary -- you alright? Sorry I missed the action -- I saw some Hyperion movement out in Tundra Express, so Bloodwing and I checked it out. Didn’t realize we were walking into a trap. Bloodwing gave me time to get away, but...the bastards grabbed her. Brought her here.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_02_echo_Mordecai.wav=Roland ECHO’d ahead. All my data’s on a chip in my bird Bloodwing’s collar, including your Claptrap upgrade. But some Hyperion jackasses nabbed her and took her into the preserve over there. I’m glad you’re here -- I’ve been scoutin’ the place for the last half-hour, and it looks like at least a two-man job. If you can get inside through the shipyard, I can give you support and lead you to Bloodwing. You get my bird, you get your Claptrap upgrade.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_03_echo_Mordecai.wav=Ah, crap. Ooh -- if you gimp enough of those loaders, but don’t kill ‘em, they’ll have to open the door to send reinforcements.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_03a_echo_Jack.wav=I watched Mordecai a lot. You know, he may be a drunken loser, but he never kept Bloodwing in a cage. Never even raised his voice at her. Funny thing -- you wanna destroy a man, you don't need to kill him. You just need to kill what he loves.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_04_echo_Mordecai.wav=Just wound ‘em, don’t kill em -- the reinforcements won’t show up otherwise.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_05_echo_Mordecai.wav=Great job! Now leave that one alone and gimp a few more.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_06_echo_Mordecai.wav=Hey! Try not to kill ‘em. You’ll need a pile of wounded bots to call out the surveyors.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_06a_echo_Mordecai.wav=Ah, hell -- I think ya killed so many of 'em they just gave up. Bad move, ese; you'll have to come back later when they've forgotten the unholy beatdown you just gave 'em.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_07_echo_Mordecai.wav=Don’t go for the kill! Just cripple ‘em!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_07a_echo_Mordecai.wav=Don't kill em -- you need 'em to ask for repairs!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_07b_echo_Mordecai.wav=Just cripple 'em, don't kill em. Otherwise you'll never get in.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_07c_echo_Mordecai.wav=If you kill em, they can't call for repairs and the door won't open. Just wound 'em.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_08_echoX_HypFemale.wav=Loaders damaged. Deploying reinforcements.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_09_echo_Mordecai.wav=Groovy -- the door’s open now. Get inside and find Bloodwing.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_10_echo_Mordecai.wav=Bloodwing should be in the holding cells at the other end of the facility. You find her, you’ll find your Claptrap upgrade.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_11_echo_Jack.wav=Oh, hey, you're in the preserve. I was gonna do this whole thing where I'd lure you in here and kill you, but you just -- you just kinda showed up. Thanks for saving me the trouble, kiddo.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_12_echo_Jack.wav=If you know how to use it, Slag isn’t just some elemental damage amplifier. It’s got much more...interesting applications.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_13_echo_Tannis.wav=Slag mutation is a volatile, brutal science that flies in the face of human ethics. Needless to say, I am extremely interested in it. Get me some samples of the slag serum Hyperion is using on the wildlife.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_14_echo_Mordecai.wav=Bloodwing should be in one of these cells. Don’t worry about the uglies in the other ones -- they can’t get to you. Just get to Bloodwing and you’ll have what you need to upgrade Claptrap and get through that death wall.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_15_echo_Jack.wav=Got the Angel back under control. WOMEN, am I right? So, you’re here for the bird? Bleedwing? Bloodwing. (trying not to laugh:) Just to warn you -- you’re really not gonna like this next part.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_15a_echo_Jack.wav=Looking for Bloodwing? Oh, I moved her a few hours ago. Somewhere a little more...dramatic.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_16_echo_Jack.wav=Hey – you know what I just remembered? (beat.) It’s feeding time.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_18_echo_Mordecai.wav=Hey, I'm sendin' you supplies.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_19_echo_Mordecai.wav=If I know Bloodwing, they're gonna have the biggest badass they can find protectin' her. Shouldn't be a problem for you, but just a heads-up.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_20_echo_PatriciaTannis.wav=You've found the slag samples? Fantastic! Leave them with Roland once you finish whatever irrelevant thing you are doing right now.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt2_2a_echo_HypFemale.wav=Unauthorized access detected. Releasing loaders.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_01_echo_Jack.wav=Want Bloodwing back, huh? Shame -- I’ve been doing some really interesting Eridium experiments with her. Hate to see her go, but  heck with it -- 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_02_echo_Jack.wav=She’s all yours.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_02a_echo_Jack.wav=(grave) This is what happens when you don’t listen, bandit.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_03_echo_Mordecai.wav=Oh my god...
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_04_echo_Mordecai.wav=Goddammit! Just--just weaken her and I’ll hit her with a tranq! 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_04a_echo_Roland.wav=Good god -- I'm sorry, soldier, but you gotta beat Bloodwing down. Do what you can to save her, but if you can't…she's got what we need to get into Control Core Angel and grab the vault key. That's what matters here.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05_echo_Mordecai.wav=(furious) Bloodwing, down! Heel! Never thought I'd say this, but stop fighting!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05a_echo_Mordecai.wav=(convincing himself) This is gonna be fine -- just gotta tranq Bloodwing, get her back to Sanctuary, and, I dunno, maybe Zed can patch her up! 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05b_echo_Mordecai.wav=Get outta the way -- she's gonna divebomb!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05c_echo_Mordecai.wav=She's divebombing! MOVE!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05d_echo_Mordecai.wav=She's diving -- look out!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05e_echo_Mordecai.wav=Back up, she's slamming the ground!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05f_echo_Mordecai.wav=She's gonna dive -- get away!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05g_echo_Mordecai.wav=Goddammit, Jack! You better pray Bloodwing makes it outta this!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05h_echo_Mordecai.wav=Watch her claws!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05i_echo_Mordecai.wav=She's comin' for ya -- look out!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05j_echo_Mordecai.wav=She's bringin' out her claws -- watch it!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05k_echo_Mordecai.wav=She's got her sights on you! MOVE!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05l_echo_Mordecai.wav=Calm down, Blood! Take it easy!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05m_echo_Mordecai.wav=Listen to me, girl! The Vault Hunter's your friend -- STOP fighting 'em!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05n_echo_Mordecai.wav=You're gonna regret ever dragging Bloodwing into this, Jack! You're gonna watch her tear your throat out!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05o_echo_Jack.wav=Heh. That's cute.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05p_echo_Mordecai.wav=Holy god, is she breathing FIRE?!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05q_echo_Mordecai.wav=She's belchin' fire again! Jesus!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05r_echo_Mordecai.wav=Watch the electricity!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_05s_echo_Mordecai.wav=She's charged with electricity, watch out!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_06_echo_Jack.wav=Just give it up, kiddo. Bloodwing’s got ALL the elements at her disposal! Slag! Fire! Electricity! Corrosion! And...and, uh...damn, I forgot the last one. What was it, again?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_06a_echo_Jack.wav=Slag, fire, electricity, corrosion...come on, Jack, you know this -- there's one more...
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_07_echo_Jack.wav=Fire!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_07a_echo_Jack.wav=Fire...what else is there?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_08_echo_Jack.wav=Electricity!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_08a_echo_Jack.wav=Electricity...slag, fire, electricity, corrosion's coming up next -- what am I forgetting?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_09_echo_Jack.wav=Corrosion!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_09a_echo_Jack.wav=Corrosion...yeah, I remember that one -- come on, what's left?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_10_echo_Jack.wav=Slag!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_10a_echo_Jack.wav=Slag...yeah, I remember that one...
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_11_echo_Mordecai.wav=I’m loadin’ the tranq dart! Tranquila, Blood -- this won’t hurt, I promise.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_12_echo_Mordecai.wav=Okay. She’s still alive. Get the microchip from her collar, and we can get her back to Sanctuary. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_13_echo_Mordecai.wav=NO!!!! 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_14_echo_Jack.wav=Oh, now I remember! EXPLOSIIIIIIVE!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_15_echo_Jack.wav=EXPLOSIIIIVE!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_16_echo_Jack.wav=That is why you don’t screw with me. You give up, you turn yourself in, or that dumbass bird is just the beginning.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_17_echo_Mordecai.wav=God damnit, Jack! I’M GONNA KILL YOU! YOU HEAR ME?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_17a_echo_Mordecai.wav= Get that upgrade to Claptrap, amigo. I don’t care what your plan is -- I’m all in.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_17a_echo_Roland.wav=I'm...sorry about Bloodwing, soldier, but we've gotta keep moving. Get that software upgrade to Claptrap, and we'll be able to get through the security field leading to Control Core Angel.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_18_echo_Jack.wav=Where the hell is -- I had a violin somewhere, I was gonna play it all sarcastically --goddammit, I saw it like a day ago. Blake! Violin!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_19_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Minion! What the HELL are you do-do-do-do-
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_20_echoX_Claptrap.wav=doo-ho-HOO! Holy skagsack -- I’m INVISIBLE! This is -- you -- I can’t...Minion: gimme five. (beat.) Oh, right. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_21_echoX_Claptrap.wav=You've earned it.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_22_echoX_Claptrap.wav=That’s what I’m talking about!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_23_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Awwww.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_24_echo_Roland.wav=Great -- Claptrap can get us through the Angel's security field now. Come on back; we may have a way past the bunker.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_25_echo_Jack.wav=Sweet, sweet. Found it! This is a song for Mordecai’s stupid bird. ... Screw you, it woulda been funny if I’d had it earlier. Shut up.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_26_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Visible...invisible! Visible! Invisible. Hey, how ya doin, I’m Claptrap and I’m INVISIBLE!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt3_27_echoX_Roland.wav=I’m sorry about Bloodwing, soldier. But there’s still more to be done if we're gonna reach Angel and get the vault key.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_01_echoX_Mordecai.wav=I'll provide support, just like in Tundra Express -- if you set somebody on fire, I'll snipe 'em!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_02_echoX_Mordecai.wav=This can't be happening…this can't be happening...
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_03_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Ah, crap. They’re chuckin’ loaders at ya? Damn -- gimme a second to think of something.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_04_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Okay, I got an idea -- if you cripple some of those loaders, but don’t kill ‘em, they’ll have to open the door to send reinforcements.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_05_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Good going -- you gotta cripple some others now.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_06_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Keep it up -- you need to damage a few more loaders.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_07_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Good -- now forget about that loader and cripple some others.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_08_echoX_Mordecai.wav=You wounded that one -- now move onto another loader.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_09_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Welcome to the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve. Jack says he built this place to promote science and discovery and whatever-the-hell, but it’s BS. They’re just using slag to experiment on every creature they can find -- you gotta get Bloodwing outta there.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_10_echo_Jack.wav=Welcome to the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve, kiddo. I’m afraid you’re not gonna like this area all that much -- it’s about knowledge. Experimentation. Discovery. You’ll see lots of complicated equipment and signs with real big words, but don’t worry -- if your brain can’t handle all the science, you can always put a bullet in it.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_11_echoX_Mordecai.wav=I still can’t believe those bastards managed to steal Bloodwing from me. A few headshotted Hyperion sergeants later, I tracked her here. I’m glad you needed that Claptrap upgrade, vault hunter -- I don’t think I coulda gotten inside on my own.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_12_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Jack makes me laugh -- he kidnapped Bloodwing so I’d start pissin’ my pants and makin’ threats that if anything happens to my bird, I’ll blah blah blah, but -- Blood and I have been through a lot. I know my girl can handle herself. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_13_echo_Jack.wav=That’s right, murderer. Keep goin’. I’ve got a surprise waiting for you at the end of the preserve. And lemme tell ya -- you’re gonna love it.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_14_echo_Jack.wav=I can’t wait for you to see the surprise. You’re gonna be like, “oh no, I'm bleeding so much, so much blood, ahhhh!” (laugh-sighing) It's gonna be great.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_15_echo_Jack.wav=I had my boys build the preserve to research the full applications of slag. See, it’s not just an elemental damage type -- if you know how to use it, slag has...lots of applications.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_16_echo_Jack.wav=Ah ah ah -- you stay back, we’re not quite ready for you yet. Don’t wanna spoil the surprise.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_17_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Bloodwing ain't there? Dammit -- Jack’s playin’ games with us.Waitaminute, waitaminute --  I'm seein' some commotion in the Observation Wing. Maybe they moved her there. Just keep pushin' through the preserve, amigo.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_17_live_Claptrap.wav=Come on. Right here. Up top. Don’t leave me hangin’, bro. Don’t make this awkward. (beat.) Well, mission failed. It’s awkward now, huh. I made it weird. Still -- you know what’d make you feel better? A high-five from your buddy Claptrap. Just imagine it -- the sharp smack of hand against hand, the feeling of accomplishment, of brotherhood -- okay, I’m making it weird again. Sorry. Okay, how about this: I’ll count to three. If you haven’t high-fived me by the time I get to three I’ll assume you don’t want a high-five. Ready? One. Two. Three. (beat.) Okay, the three count was a dumb idea. You clearly want to high-five me, you’re just not sure how. I understand. Fear not, though -- you need only smack my hand, and bam -- high-five complete. Okay. Ready? ...Go!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_18_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Didja find her? She okay?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_21_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Open friggin’ sesame. I blasted the security terminal -- the way should be open now.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_22_echoX_Mordecai.wav=The way’s blocked, huh? Lemme get that for you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_23_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Aaand open! Hehe.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_24_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Hold up -- lemme clear the way.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_25_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Path’s clear, amigo.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_26_echo_Jack.wav=Woah woah woah -- you didn’t think you’re getting out of here ALIVE, did you?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_27_echo_HypFemale.wav=Intruder in range. Deploying reinforcements.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_28_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Vault Hunter -- get down.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_29_echoX_Mordecai.wav=DIE, ASSHOLES! SCREW YOU! SCREW YOU! VETE AL DIABLO, YOU SONS OF BITCHES!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_30_echoX_Mordecai.wav=(violent, rage-filled yell)
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep10_Pt4_31_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Woah woah woah, hold up -- the door just…opened. That’s weird…why would Jack let us into the preserve? Head on in, I guess…but cuidado, amigo.
Voices\English(US)\VO_EP11_Pt1_01_echoX_Roland.wav=Take this note to thousand cuts.
Voices\English(US)\VO_EP11_Pt1_02_echoX_Roland.wav=You’re going to deliver that note to a bandit leader known as the Slab King. He used to be part of the Crimson Raiders, until his methods got too brutal. I didn’t think ripping Hyperion officials limb from limb in front of their loved ones was an effective way to get intel. (beat.) He disagreed. Still, he owes me a favor, and he can help us get past the bunker outside Control Core Angel.
Voices\English(US)\VO_EP11_Pt1_02a_echoX_Roland.wav=Thousand Cuts is west of the Highlands -- if you're looking for the Slab King, that's where he'll be. Be careful, though -- he kinda...lost it after Hyperion killed his dog.
Voices\English(US)\VO_EP11_Pt1_03_echo_Roland.wav=Control Core Angel is at the top of that mountain -- that's where the Vault Key's being held. The Slab King is up on the other cliff. He can help us get past the bunker outside the control core. Hopefully.
Voices\English(US)\VO_EP11_Pt1_03a_echoX_Bandit.wav=Intruder! We got an intruder!
Voices\English(US)\VO_EP11_Pt1_04_echo_Brick.wav=Intruder, huh? Sounds like Hyperion sent another assassin! Alrights, boys: Fight like badasses, or die like bitches!
Voices\English(US)\VO_EP11_Pt1_05_echo_Roland.wav=You’ll have to fight through the slabs to reach the King -- be careful.
Voices\English(US)\VO_EP11_Pt1_06_echo_Brick.wav=I tried to keep to myself, but nooo! You Hyperion bastards HAD to come after me -- you just HAD to kill Dusty!...You wanna treat me like a bandit, that’s EXACTLY what I’m gonna be!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt1_03_echo_Angel.wav=To breach the final door to my chambers, you’ll need to be Jack -- that means passing a bio-scan and speaking a password in his voice. If you can kill one of Jack’s body doubles in Opportunity, I can get you through that door. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt1_04_echo_Roland.wav=(sigh.) Much as I hate tellin’ you to listen to her, Angel’s the best lead we got. You already know not to trust her, but...be careful.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt1_05_echo_Angel.wav=With every passing moment, I get closer to charging the Vault Key. If this planet is to survive, you must reach me and get the key.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt2_01_echo_Angel.wav=That's one of the body doubles Jack uses to confuse assassins, and impress his underlings.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt2_05_live_JacksDouble.wav=It is nearly as good as intercourse, which I am very good at.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt2_06_echo_Angel.wav=Grab the pocketwatch device he dropped. It echoes his bio-signature to every machine in the immediate area, so his doubles can do all of his hand-kissing and baby-shaking for him.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt2_07_echo_Angel.wav=Good -- you've got Jack's bio-data, but there's still the matter of the password. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt3_01_echo_Angel.wav=That pocketwatch also records audio -- Jack loved to listen to the praise of his underlings. We need to create a voice modulator so you can speak in Jack’s voice. Get to an info kiosk.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt3_03_echoX_Jack.wav=Did you know that some people on this planet still believe in silly superstitions like angels, demons, and ancient alien warriors? We like to call them “bandits.”
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt3_04_echo_Angel.wav=Yes! This is going to work -- if I get a few more samples of Jack’s voice, I can make a voice modulator for you. You need to get more voice samples from the other info kiosks.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt3_05_echo_Jack.wav=Nice try, idiot. I bet you thought you’d won, but that was just a body double. And now you’re gonna die.

Your family is paid to be here -- I’m the one who feeds and protects everyone. Remember: we should all love our parents, but love me more.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt3_14_echo_Angel.wav=I’ve got everything we need. Get to an ECHO terminal so I can give you the voice modulator.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt3_19_echo_Angel.wav=All done. Grab the watch.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt3_20_echo_Angel.wav=Great! Now, unfortunately, you will speak in Jack's voice until you reach the security door. I will tell you the password to open it at the appropriate time.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt3_21_echo_Angel.wav=AAGH!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep12_Pt3_22_echo_Jack.wav=You seriously thought you could hide from me, Angel? Say goodbye to your friend. Say it.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_06_echo_Jack.wav=Don’t you know what you’re DOING?! Who cares about the goddamn key -- you’re gonna end the life of an innocent girl!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_07_echo_Angel.wav=Jack ended my life long ago. This has to end NOW, Vault Hunter.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_09_live_Lilith.wav=(protracted, pained grunts of exertion)
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_10_live_Jack.wav=Do it, Lilith.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_11_live_Lilith.wav=NO!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_12_echo_Lilith.wav=Are you okay? Did I get you to Sanctuary? (beat) I feel…wrong. This device Jack's using on me --
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_13_echo_Jack.wav=It's the same technology I used with my daughter. But unlike you, she knew how to listen. It's time for you to learn who's in charge. The hard way.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_14_echo_Jack.wav=Angel…I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_14_echo_Lilith.wav=(scream o' pain)
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_15_echo_Jack.wav=Do you really think I'd protect Angel with nothing but a couple bots and some flimsy turrets? See, you're not at the bunker right now. The bunker isn't a place.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_15_echoX_Angel.wav=I’m sorry for lying, but if you knew I wasn’t a machine, you might not have been willing to come here and...shut me down.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_16_echo_Jack.wav=THAT's the bunker. Meet the BNK-3R, the greatest defense bot ever built. I designed her myself. Now do me a favor and die.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_16_echoX_Angel.wav=I can't stop Jack's defenses! Be careful!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_17_echoX_Angel.wav=Eridium alone could never charge the Vault Key. It needs a catalyst -- something to awaken its power. It needs…a Siren.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_18_echoX_Angel.wav=Jack acquired his Siren catalyst a long time ago. He kept her hidden from the world for years, but finally -- you will be able to set her free. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_19_echoX_Angel.wav=To truly stop Jack from waking the Warrior, you cannot just steal the vault key -- you must destroy his catalyst.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_20a_echoX_Angel.wav=me.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep13_Pt5_21_echoX_Angel.wav=Jack's spent years pumping me full of Eridium, using me to charge his key and manipulate his enemies. Destroying the Eridium injectors that keep me...alive...will stop the key from charging. And it will end a lifetime of servitude. Now -- 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_01_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Vault Hunter...you’re all we got left. Jack killed Roland. He killed Bloodwing. But he is not gonna kill Lilith. Jack still needs time to charge the Vault Key -- you just need to find out where this warrior is buried. There’s only one place on Pandora  that’d have that kinda info: the Hyperion Info Stockade. Get there.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_01a_echo_Mordecai.wav=That highway leads to the Info Stockade. We get in there, we find out where the Warrior is.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_01b_echo_HypFemale.wav=Intruders detected. Locking  path to  Info Stockade.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_01d_echo_Mordecai.wav=Dammit! Jack doesn't want us getting close to him. Brick, you got a plan to get to the stockade?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_01e_echoX_Brick.wav=Blow stuff up, that's my plan. Vault hunter: get to Sawtooth Cauldron.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_01f_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Welcome to the Eridium Blight. Before Hyperion, this place was…well, still a craphole, but it wasn't THIS bad.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_02a_echo_Lilith.wav=(grunt of pain, then, furiously:) Jack's making me charge the Vault Key. So here's what happens next. You find me. You kill Jack. And if you can't stop me from waking  the Warrior? You put a bullet in my head.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_03_echo_Brick.wav=My boys can blast open the path to the info Stockade, but they'll need some better firepower. You're gonna steal some explosives for ‘em.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_04_echo_Brick.wav=Yeah, the bandits livin’ in the Cauldron are old rivals of the Slabs, so don’t feel bad. We’re just gonna steal their stuff and kill most of ‘em.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_04a_echo_Brick.wav=To get to where Sawtooth bandits are keepin' the bombs, you gotta go through Guano Grotto. You'll have to push through a buttload of Sawteeth, but hell -- wouldn't be any fun otherwise, right?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt1_04b_echo_Brick.wav=Ah, this takes me back. Last time I was here, I had Tiny Tina ridin' piggbyback, throwin' grenades at the Sawteeth while I punched 'em into red mist. The looks on their faces -- ahahahahah! Ohh, I have killed a lot of people.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt2_01_echo_Brick.wav=You’ve gotta steal some Y-94 Odomo charges if you wanna get into the info stockade and find the Warrior. Take the elevator to get to where they store ‘em.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt2_03_echo_Brick.wav=Hrm -- looks like the elevator's not moving. You gotta piss Mortar off so he’ll take the elevator down...the Boombringer! Mortars prized buzzard -- go find it.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt2_04_echo_Brick.wav=Blast Boombringer to bits. Mortar won’t be happy to see his buzzard go up in smoke, so he’ll take the elevator down to fight ya. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt2_05_echo_Brick.wav=Oh, and after you blast Boombringer, don’t look at the explosion -- just walk away from it. You’ll look like such a badass.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt2_06_EchoX_Mortar.wav=Boombringer! NO! That’s it, slab -- I’m comin’ down there and YOU are find out what it’s like to eat your own throat!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt2_06a_echo_Lilith.wav=When it comes down to it, you'll have to kill Jack yourself. Brick and Mordecai need to protect Sanctuary if Jack gains control over the warrior. But so long as either of us have a bullet in our guns, that's not gonna happen.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt2_07_echo_Mortar.wav=That slab just blew up my buzzard without even lookin’ at the explosion! But I -- I ain’t scared -- I’m comin’ down and YOU’RE GONNA DIE!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt2_08_echo_Brick.wav=Sounds like you can take the elevator now. Feel free to kill Mortar on your way up.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt2_10_echo_Brick.wav=Ahh. You really are the best slab ever.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt3_01_echo_Brick.wav=My boys are gonna come in and steal the explosives, but the skies gotta be clear first. Take out those buzzards.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt3_02_echo_Brick.wav=Man, why don't these guys just give up? You already killed their boss! Idiots.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt3_03_echo_Brick.wav=Cool. Now mark those crates for pickup and my boys’ll come get ‘em. They’ll need those charges to blast open the path to the Info Stockade.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt3_03a_echo_Jack.wav=(imitating Roland’s voice) Hey, buddy! It’s me, Roland! Let's kill Handsome Jack and then we'll ALL go out for milkshakes!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt3_03b_echo_Jack.wav=Naw, I’m just playing. He’s still really dead. Grabbed his ECHO unit when I left. (Beat) Just wanted to tell you that Lilith is doing a bang-up job charging the Vault Key for me. The Warrior will be awake in no time.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt3_08_echo_Brick.wav=Grab the crates holdin’ the charges -- they’re the only kind of explosive that can burn through the defenses at the info stockade.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt3_08a_echo_Brick.wav=Well done! Just jump off the east end of the tower if you wanna get  back to the fast-travel station in the quickest and badassest way possible.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt3_09_echo_Brick.wav= Badass job, Slab! You remind me of me, back in the old days.  With those Odomo charges,my boys'll help you break into the Info Stockade and find out where Jack's got Lilith and the Warrior. I'll let Mordecai know you're headed back to Sanctuary.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt3_10_echoX_Brick.wav=Good luck, slab. Mordecai’ll help you get into the Info Stockade.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt4_01_echo_Jack.wav=People of Pandora...my daughter is...dead. Murdered. By the vault hunter. So I’ve decided -- I’m rescinding the bounty on the vault hunter. If you should kill that child-murdering sonofabitch before I do? I will find you. And you will regret denying me my vengeance.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt4_02_echo_Brick.wav=My Slabs have been fightin’ the Sawteeth for years. These bastards handed dozens of Vault Hunters to Jack once the pay got good enough. You kill ‘em all, Vault Hunter. And you smile while you do it.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt4_03_echo_Brick.wav=There’s nothin Mortar loves more than his buzzard, Boombringer. If you destroy it, he’ll be so pissed he’ll  have to ride the elevator down to take revenge on ya. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt4_04_echo_Jack.wav=I wanna be clear about something. This isn’t about Pandora anymore. It’s about you...and me. I can never replace what you took from me. But murdering your Vault Hunter pals? Destroying that flying city? Hell -- that’s a start.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt4_05_echo_Jack.wav=Do me a favor. You think about how all of Roland’s training, all his experience counted for nothing once he met me. And ask yourself, if I could kill the wise leader of the Crimson Raiders without breaking a sweat, how hard will it be to kill a psychotic bandit king and a drunken frickin' sniper?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt4_06_echo_Lilith.wav=Unghhh...I can feel this thing around my neck sapping me dry. Promise me -- so long as there’s a bullet left in your gun, promise me you’ll make. Jack. Pay.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep15_Pt4_07_echo_Brick.wav=Slab, did you -- did you just jump off The Buzzard's Nest? ...God DAMN you make me proud!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_01_echoX_Mordecai.wav=We’ve gotta find out where the Warrior is buried -- we find that, we find Lilith and Jack. That kind of data could only be held in one place: The Hyperion Info Stockade. Head to the Arid Nexus.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_01a_echo_Lilith.wav=I can feel the Warrior stirring -- I dunno how much longer I can hold it back. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_01b_echo_Brick.wav=Keep your head down, slab -- my boys are startin' their run!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_01c_echo_Brick.wav=That oughtta do it -- the way to the Info Stockade is open. Get in there, and find out where Jack's got Lilith and the Warrior. While you’re doin’ that, I’m gonna pay a visit to a Hyperion outpost -- see if I can’t steal some heavy armor for our final assault on Jack.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_02_echo_Mordecai.wav=You see that building with the light shootin’ out of it? That’s the Info Stockade. We're gonna get you there through the main Eridium pipeline -- head there now.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_02a_echo_Mordecai.wav=That highway leads to the Nexus. There's a lift in Fyrestone that'll get you up there.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_02b_echo_Mordecai.wav=There should be a ladder on the side of the pipe leading to a maintenance hatch. You can use that to get inside the pipeline. It'll be messy, but it'll lead you to the stockade.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_02c_echo_Mordecai.wav=God dammit! You okay? Rrgh -- looks like the ladder's busted. Still, the pipe looks cracked -- I bet if you raised the pressure, you could blast the pipe wide open. Get inside that way. Yeah -- head to one of the pumping stations.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_03_echo_Mordecai.wav=Good, you made it. Now crank those valves to raise the pressure.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_04_echo_Mordecai.wav=Cool. Now, hit the other two pump stations and raise the pressure ‘til that pipe’s fit to burst. Then you can bust the pipe, get into the Stockade, and find out where the Warrior's buried.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_05_echo_Mordecai.wav=Sounds like the pipes are nearly bursting. Hit the last pumping station and we'll be ready to blast the pipeline open.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_06_echo_Mordecai.wav=Great -- the pressure in the pipeline's so high, a little force will pop it like a blister. Get back to the pipeline, and bring your vehicle -- I got an idea.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt1_07_echo_Mordecai.wav=You're there? Good. Now -- ram the pipe with your vehicle. Probably won't kill you. Hopefully.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt2_01_echo_Mordecai.wav=Good. It should only take a few shots in the right place to bust that pipe wide open.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt2_02_echo_Mordecai.wav=Hijo de puta -- I heard that all the way back in Sanctuary! You can get to the Stockade through the pipeline now. Get inside, and find out where Jack's got the Warrior.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt2_02a_echo_Mordecai.wav=Eh. Kinda thought the explosion'd be bigger. Either way, You can get to the Stockade through the pipeline now. Get inside, and find out where Jack's got the Warrior.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt2_03_echo_Mordecai.wav=Every bit of data in the Hyperion network ends up archived here. Mining information, security footage, Jack’s...sexecution tapes -- it all flows to the Stockade. Get inside.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt2_04_echo_Mordecai.wav=Great job, amigo. Now that you're in, there oughtta be an info terminal nearby. Find it.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt2_05_echo_Mordecai.wav=There -- Jack’s sent all the Eridium he’s mined straight to the Hero's Pass. That must be where the warrior’s buried! Get back to Sanctuary -- it’s time to get ready for the final assault.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt2_06_echo_Lilith.wav=Kid...you gotta hurry...
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt2_07_echo_Jack.wav=Lilith has quite the little mouth on her -- and, as it turns out, when that Eridium is pumping through her body, I can stab her over and over and over and it just heals right back up. (beat) I’m told it’s agonizing. Oh, she looks pissed.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt3_01_live_Claptrap.wav=This is all my fault! I hide in Sanctuary, he attacks it. I draw some graffiti on his cliff...and he kills Roland. It’s my fault, minion -- and I’m tired of running.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt4_01_echo_Lilith.wav=I can feel Jack’s drills getting closer to  the Warrior’s chamber --  you gotta stop Jack, vault hunter.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt4_02_echo_Jack.wav=I bet you think I’m a monster. You think I enslaved Angel. But you didn’t see what she did to her mother. I had to restrain Angel’s power. You get that? I had to.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt4_03_echo_Lilith.wav=And I’m sure he had to exploit her for profit and power, too. Don’t listen, Vault Hunter -- he killed Angel long before you pulled the plug --
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep16_Pt4_04_echo_Lilith.wav=Uhhn--

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_47a_echo_Angel.wav=It's a long way to Sanctuary -- please  take whatever you need for the journey ahead.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_47b_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Lemme know when you're ready to go meet with Sir Hammerlock, minion.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_47c_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Can't wait for Hammerlock to screw my eye back in. Me and him are thick as thieves, specifically in that I once stole his gas-powered generator because I had a crush on it. Don't judge.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_47e_echoX_Claptrap.wav=This way to Southern Shelf, minion -- let's go! Maybe! ...Or, not! We’ll go at your pace! I’m obviously the head of this operation, of course, but you’re the Vault Hunter with the brawn. And the guns. And the power of sight. Which is exactly what you want out of a minion, really. That’s, like, three of the top four things one generally wants out of a minion. You’ll figure out the fourth when the time is right. (beat.) The fourth is pizzazz.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_48_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Nice boomsticks, friendo! You're looking swank! Now, to get to Sanctuary, we've gotta retrieve my boat from the clutches of Captain Flynt. He's a real douche: dumb as a bag of wrenches, smells like old ham--
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_48a_echo_Hammerlock.wav=Spectacular -- first Captain Flynt’s bandits attack, THEN Claptrap shows up! I must have been horrifyingly cruel to puppies in a previous life to deserve this kind of treatment. I say, Vault Hunter -- could you kill Flynt’s men for me?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_49_echo_Flynt.wav=Hey -- Vault Hunter! Give yourself up peacefully, and maybe my men won’t knit a Christmas sweater out of your intestines!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_49a_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Now, if you could hand me the robot's eye, please.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_50_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Protect me, minion! Captain Flynt used to treat me like a sentient banana hammock!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_51b_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Hey, Hammerlock! Since my minion just saved your town, you wanna do your bestie Claptrap a favor and repair my eye?!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_51c_echo_Hammerlock.wav=(sigh.) Yes, I suppose I am in your debt now, aren't I? Come to my shack, and I shall restore Claptrap's sight. First, I shall shut off the electrical fence for you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_51d_echoX_Claptrap.wav=I knew Hammerlock would come around eventually. Me and him are like two peas in a pod! Two bullets in a mag! Two cannibal midgets in a fat guy's ribcage!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_51n_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Minion! Now I've got my eyesight back -- and you're far uglier than I remembered! Time to join up with the Crimson Raiders in Sanctuary! This glacier’s full of nothing but murderers or jerkbags, like that Hammerlock dude!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_51p_echoX_Claptrap.wav=We've gotta get to the city of Sanctuary. And that means getting my ship back from the nefarious Captain Flynt. Lemme know when you wanna go!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_51q_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Now that Liar's Berg is clear, I might as well turn on the main power -- this town's full of things that may be of use to a go-getting slayer of men like yourself.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_51r_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Ah, there you are.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_51s_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=So, how are you enjoying Liar's Berg? This town used to have a spectacular amount of hustle and/or bustle before its denizens fled to Sanctuary to escape Jack's army. Most of them, anyway. Captain Flynt's men killed anyone who stayed.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_51t_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Oh, and if you require a shield, I know where you can get one!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_51u_echoX_Claptrap.wav=I'm in no rush to see Captain Flynt again, minion -- take your time! Do some missions from the bounty board!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_52_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Suck it, Flynt! My new minion's a bonafide badass! 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_53_echoX_Claptrap.wav=I'm just saying that for show, minion. Don't let it go to your head. You don't even have a shield yet -- we should see to that.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_54_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Flynt and I have had a gentlemen's agreement in the past. I give him the loot from the bodies Jack ditches in the glacier, he promises not to torture me for hours at a time, then he does it anyway. But that ends today! We're gonna take him out, steal my ship back, and sail to Sanctuary! 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_54a_echo_Flynt.wav=Here’s what’s gonna happen, Vault Hunter. My first mate Boom Boom is gonna kill ya, Jack’s gonna pay us, and I’m gonna play hopscotch in your chest cavity!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_54b_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Hmm -- I know Boom Boom is guarding the path to my ship, but I can't remember where he is. Why doncha look around for him, minion?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt1_54c_echoX_Claptrap.wav=That's definitely Boom Boom's place, but it looks like the entrance is locked. Better go find the key!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt2_19_live_Claptrap.wav=That whole “leaving you to the Bullymongs” thing was a test. And you passed.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt2_20_Live_Claptrap.wav=Ugh -- AGAIN?! Jack’s tearing Pandora apart to find the vault. They say Jack’s drilling operations are causing those earthquakes. That, or your mom just got outta bed. ZING!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt2_42_echo_Angel.wav=If I could, um, make a suggestion? You could shoot the fuse box to shut off the electricity, then grab the capacitor.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt2_43_echoX_Claptrap.wav=--Ooh! Maybe grab it with your teeth!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt2_44_echo_Angel.wav=In general, ignore any advice Claptrap gives you.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt3_01_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Alright, minion, we’re ready to kill Captain Flynt and take my ship back! You’ll need some grenades first, though -- I bet Flynt’s servant, Boom-Boom, has some.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt3_02_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Be careful taking down Boom-Boom. He’s one of the “ripper” clan. As in, fleshripper. I don’t have to tell you why they’re called that.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt3_03_echoX_Claptrap.wav=They’re called that because they rip people’s flesh off.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt3_12_echoX_Claptrap.wav=I wish I had legs.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt3_13_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Boom-Boom was the first lieutenant on Flynt's ship. Real nice guy, if you don't mind being tortured everytime he's drunk, which is always.

Vault Hunter gets killed. By me. Seeing the problem here? You're still alive. So, if you could just do me a favor and off yourself, that’d be great. Thanks, pumpkin.

So don’t do that! I’m just standing here to show you the area you should shoot after I move away, which I will once I am totally convinced you understand the instructions I am relaying to you! Do you understand? I know it’s kind of complicated, but just stick with me! When it’s okay for you to shoot this gate with the cannon, I’ll say something like, “SHOOT THE GATE WITH THE CANNON, NOW!” But that was just a test. You didn’t shoot the gate when I said that, which was good. “SHOOT THE GATE WITH THE CANNON, NOW!” Also another test. You’re doing me proud, minion. ...Actually, I’m getting bored. Just shoot the gate now for realsies.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt3_27_echoX_Claptrap.wav=AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt3_28_echoX_Claptrap.wav=(with punching and kicking noises in the background) So, - I might have tried to stage a mutiny on Captain Flynt’s ship before the flash-freeze.  Which explains why his men are currently beating the crap out of me. Right, guys?

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt3_33a_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Ow! Guys, you don’t HAVE to beat me up -- we can talk this through, right? Here, I’ll do it for you! “Hey Claptrap, how are you?” “Oh, I’m fine -- I kinda wish you wouldn’t beat me up, though. “Why?” “Cause it really hurts!” “You make a good point, Claptrap, but beating you up makes US feel really good!” “I know, I know, guys, but it makes ME feel really bad!” “But Claptrap, you’re a robot -- are you even capable of feeling pain?” “Well, uh, no, I guess I’m not.” “So, pummelling you makes us feel good, and DOESN’T hurt you, there’s no harm in us continuing to do it, right?”  ...Actually, now that I’ve talked it all out, I think you guys have the moral high ground, here. Pummel away!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_Pt4_03_echo_Angel.wav=You'll need more loot than that to survive out here. Gimme a sec.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_pt4_09_echo_Jack.wav=(munching on pretzels) So, how’s your day been, buddy? We haven’t really talked much since I left you for dead. Hey, you think you’ll freeze to death out there? Nah, probably not. The bandits’ll get you first. (beat.) My day? It's been pretty good. I just bought a pony made of diamonds, because I’m rich. So, you know. That’s cool. (beat.) Kay, bye.

Handsome Jack here, offering a million bucks to whomever brings me the head of the Vault Hunter who just arrived in Liar’s Berg.

Many thanks for disposing of them, by the way -- to survive a direct run-in with Handsome Jack AND defeat Captain Flynt's bandits? Unheard of. I’m headed to Sanctuary, myself --  from what I hear, the Crimson Raiders there could use a hero like you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_pt4_26_live_Marcus.wav=This is Marcus of Marcus Munitions -- be sure to check out my storefront in Sanctuary!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_pt4_27_echo_Angel.wav=Stick close to the robot -- he will help you get off this glacier, and into the city of Sanctuary, where the resistance is based. Whether they know it or not, the Crimson Raiders need us. They need YOU. Until then, please resist the urge to shoot Claptrap in the face. This may well be your most difficult challenge in the coming days.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_pt4_28_echo_Flynt.wav=Got a proposition for ya, vault hunter. You give up, we’ll just shoot ya in the head. It’ll be quick, clean, and a hell of a lot less painful than what Handsome Jack’ll do  to ya.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_pt4_29_echo_Flynt.wav=Time for our payday, boys -- let’s turn up the HEAT!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_pt4_31_echo_Angel.wav=Once upon a time, four vault hunters changed Pandora forever. But their time has passed -- thanks to Handsome Jack, Pandora needs a new hero. I know that hero is you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep2_pt4_32_echo_Angel.wav=Captain Flynt is  -- pardon my language -- a jerk. If you kill him, you’ll be able to reach Sanctuary. You’ll also have raised the average literacy rate of this glacier by at least thirty percent.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt1_01_live_Claptrap.wav=We’re near Sanctuary, minion. You go on ahead -- tell the locals what we’ll require for my “welcome back” party. I’ll stay in here and give ‘em time to get what we need. Number one: ladies. Obvious. Number two: dudes. But hideous ones. we’re talkin’ morbidly obese, we’re talkin’ body odor, we’re talkin’ acne scars. The ladies’ll take one look at these uggos and BAM! I start lookin’ pretty good! Suddenly, it’s not, “ew, get away from me you pervy little robot, you’re creeping me out, why are you crying, I didn’t even know robots could cry, look, if I give you a hug will you stop crying, alright, but keep that disc tray inside, OH GOD WHAT IS THIS, MOTOR OIL?” It’ll be more like, “Claptrap, rescue me from these uggos and hump my leg,” which I WILL. Number three: we’ll need booze, in case that other stuff doesn’t work. Number four: streamers. Number fi-- are you writing all this down? Minion? Are you even-- you even here? Still? Lonely.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt1_10_Echo_Angel.wav=Damnit -- er, sorry. Darnit. A man named Scooter controls these catch-a-ride machines -- he may be short a few chromosomes, but he's a savant when it comes to vehicles. He's locked this station to prevent the bandits from using it, but I’m reading an inactive Hyperion bot in the Bloodshot camp.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt2_02_Live_Reiss.wav=*Cough* A vault hunter? Didn't think I rated that much of a rescue. One of those psychos ran off with the power core. Without it, Sanctuary'll be defenseless.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt2_03c_Echo_Angel.wav=Great! Now head to Sanctuary and find Roland. He’ll want to meet the vault hunter who stared down Handsome Jack and lived.

Name’s Roland -- used to be a vault hunter like you, until I formed the Crimson Raiders. We’ll catch up when I get back to Sanctuary -- for now, I need your help. My men tell me Corporal Reiss hasn’t returned with the power core we need to keep the city’s shields running. Bring Reiss back to Sanctuary, and you’ll have earned your place in the Raiders.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt4_05_echo_Angel.wav=Roland’s contacted you? Good. Listen to what he says -- he can help us defeat Jack.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt4_06_echo_LtDavis.wav=We’re to keep the gate closed until you return with the power core. Roland’s orders.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt4_07_echo_Roland.wav=Reiss is in trouble? Dammit -- we’re spread thin enough as it is. Find him, soldier.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt4_08_echoX_Reiss.wav=Get that core back to Sanctuary. I’m just gonna take a nap -- wake me up when I’m not on Pandora anymore.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt4_09_echo_Roland.wav=Reiss is dead? He was one of the first Crimson Lancemen I recruited to the Raiders. (beat.) And he was a good guy. Get that power core back. And while you’re at it, kill some bandits for Reiss.  It’s what he woulda wanted.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt4_10_echo_Jack.wav=This is a message to Sanctuary, (mockingly) “the last stronghold of the resistance.” Pandora as you knew it -- the chaos, the bandits -- that time has passed. If you let it, this could be an era of order -- of peace! Just turn yourselves in, and I promise: your deaths will be quick.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt4_11_echo_Jack.wav=You like my speech? I was lying about the last part, by the way. I’m gonna spend a lowng time torturing you bandit scum to death. And I’ll enjoy it even more because -- ah, I shouldn’t say anymore. I’ve got a little secret that I, uh -- you know what? You don’t need to hear it -- it’ll probably just confuse ya. Ciao!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt4_12_echo_Roland.wav=That’s the power core -- great. Jack won’t destroy Sanctuary today, at least. Get back to the city. We’ll meet up once I get there. Welcome to the Crimson Raid-- (we hear gunfire). Ah, dammit. I’m being attacked, I’ll see -- (we hear more gunfire, then static)
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt4_13_echo_LtDavis.wav=The resistance lost a good man today. But I’m sure Reiss woulda been happy to know how quickly you wiped out those Bloodshots.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep3_Pt4_14_echo_LtDavis.wav=Roland?! Is that you?! Oh, it’s the vault hunter -- get in, quick! Roland’s ECHO communicator went dead, we need your help!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt2_20_Live_Tannis.wav=As I've said, Roland, now that Jack has the Vault Key, it is only a matter of time until he awakens the warrior. Also, I require a new ventilator -- this lab smells of bacon. Bacon is for sycophants, and products of incest.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt2_21_Live_Tannis.wav=Wait, you're not Roland, or even of close facial symmetry.  Well if you're here for the Fuel Cell, then you'll have to bring me an item impressive enough that my loins skitter forth from retirement. Oh, don’t give me "overshare" face! 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt2_23_EchoX_Scooter.wav=Great! Shove that tater-tot into another one of them engine dougies right there.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt2_23a_EchoX_Scooter.wav=Got another cell? Kickass. Just jam it inta a fuel injector in the center of town.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt3_11_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Vault Hunter! How good to see you again. Thanks to the thorough drubbing you delivered upon Captain Flynt, I was able to leave the Southern Shelf and get back to the business of finishing my almanac. Would you care to help me out?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_01_echo_Jack.wav=Made it to Banditville, huh? Well done! (beat) It’ll be nice to see a friendly face when I’m burning that place to the ground. Oh, and I’ve decided that I will tell you my secret later on. Once you’ve earned it.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_02_echOX_LtDavis.wav=You’re the one Commander Roland was talkin’ about. The one who faced Jack and lived. Look, we need your help, bad, but first thing’s first -- plug that power core into the shield generator.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_03_echoX_LtDavis.wav=Good. That oughtta last us a day or two.(sighing) Roland was supposed to bring us some intel on how to stop Jack -- with him missing, we really need your help. Talk to Private Jessup at the gate. He’ll let you into the city.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_05_echoX_PvtJessup.wav=Hello, uh, sir -- ma’am -- uh, vault hunter. Let me get the gate for you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_06_echoX_PvtJessup.wav=Commander Roland never came back from his secret reconnaissance mission. He left very specific orders for this contingency which you can help carry out. Go meet with the town mechanic.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_08_echoX_LtDavis.wav=Hyperion moonshot blitz. Without that fresh core you brought, those lunar mortars woulda punched right through the shield.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_11_live_Scooter.wav=You’ll never take me alive, you robotic sumbitch!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_12_echoX_Scooter.wav=Wait a minute...! Well, hang me upside down from a telephone pole, cover me in honey, and leave me to a slow death at the hands of hungry spiderants -- you ain’t a Hyperion robot, you’re a vault hunter! That’s like a unicorn!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_13_echoX_Scooter.wav=You gonna help us with this Roland situation? I heard them Crimson Raider dudes talkin’ about it. Roland told me if he ever disappeared, I was supposed ta initiate Plan B -- or, as I like to call it, Plan Turn-this-city-into-a-floatin’-ass-fortress-of-airborne-awesomeness. B. I got some fuel cells around here. You’ll need those -- oh, and you’ll need this here Eridium, too.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_14_echoX_Scooter.wav=Head to the center a' town and plug those two fuel cells into the ignition primers. You gon’ need a third, which is why I gave you that there rid-rock -- you can buy the last cell from Earl’s black market. Careful though, Earl’s crazy--he ate one of my cars once. Yes. The whole car. Just with, like, a fork. It was awesome.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_15_echoX_Scooter.wav=Roland said we gotta have an exit strategery just in case he ever disappeared, hence all the fuel cells and whatnot. Bummer, though -- he really wanted to meet ya. Raiders ain’t gonna last without some new blood, and given how you shot them bandits up I’d say you and blood got an extra-special relationship. Like cousins takin' a bath together.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_16_echoX_SgtTimmins.wav=Vault hunter! Get in -- Roland left a message for you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep4_Pt4_17_echo_Roland.wav=Hey, soldier. If you’re hearing this, I’m in trouble. Right now, you’re the only thing standing between this city -- hell, the whole planet -- and Handsome Jack’s army. I left info about my whereabouts in my safe.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt1_03_EchoX_Scooter.wav=The Firehawk? You mean the mass-murderin' bounty hunter?! Oh, crap -- if the Firehawk’s got him, Roland is in DEEP. You gotta get to Frostburn Canyon and rescue his ass!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt1_04_EchoX_Moxxi.wav=Well, hello. Don't just stand there looking gorgeous -- the drinks don't cost much, but information's a bit pricier.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt2_01b_Echo_Scooter.wav=So yeah, I'd be real damn careful getting Roland back from the Firehawk. They say one time a dude winged the Firehawk with a bullet -- just winged him! -- and he straight up ate the sumbitch alive. NOM NOM NOM!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt2_01c_Echo_Angel.wav=If Roland has been captured by the Firehawk, he's in danger. You're the only one who can stop Jack, but Roland is the man with the plan, so to speak -- he knows the best way to strike at Hyperion.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt2_01d_Echo_Angel.wav=I see you've met the Incinerator clan. They say these bandits have been driven insane by the Firehawk's atrocities. Well -- more insane than your usual bandits, anyway.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt2_01e_Echo_Scooter.wav=Woah! You feel that?! Before he got his ass probly-killed, Roland said them quakes was cuz of some big alien Warrior thingy. Tween you and me, I think Ro-ro's gone a little cuckoo, know what I'm sayin? 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt2_02_Live_Bandit3.wav=It's not human! Oh God, it's not human!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt3_01_EchoX_Lilith.wav=Oof. I need a pick-me-up. Get me some Eridium, will ya? I should have some in one of my strong boxes.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt3_14d_EchoX_Lilith.wav=Thanks very much.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt3_14e_EchoX_Lilith.wav=Much appreciated.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt3_15_EchoX_Lilith.wav=Ahhhh. Yeah -- since the Vault opened, my Siren powers have been getting a little... awesome, thanks to this Eridium stuff. No idea why. Now, let’s talk about rescuing my boyfriend.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt3_16_EchoX_Lilith.wav=Well...ex-boyfriend.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt3_17_EchoX_Lilith.wav=Before the Bloodshots grabbed him, Roland was getting intel on the Vault, and what Jack plans to do with it. You have to find him. I gotta head back to Sanctuary, keep the city in one piece while Roland's away. But first, I’m gonna teleport you into the Bloodshot Stronghold -- that's where they're keeping Roland. You’ll catch ‘em by surprise and have a real advantage. It’ll be great. Hold still.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt3_18_EchoX_Lilith.wav=...I just moved you, like, ten feet, didn’t I?  Sorry. I’m still getting used to this. Reminds me, though -- Bloodshot Stronghold is full of real tough customers -- you might wanna train a bit before you take ‘em on.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_01_echo_BloodshotBandit.wav=We ain’t scared of ya anymore, Firehawk! 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_01_echo_Lilith.wav=This is the Firehawk. Come to Frostburn Canyon or people will die.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_02_echo_Angel.wav=That’s weird -- the Bloodshot bandit clan seems to be attacking the Firehawk’s lair. They’ve probably left landmarks for their reinforcements  -- those should lead you to the Firehawk. That, or just...follow the screaming.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_03_echo_Flanksteak.wav=Step off, vault hunter -- this is between the Bloodshots and the Firehawk! Once my boys bring his ass back to me, he’s gonna pay for every Bloodshot he killed! We’re gonna string him up from his own freakin’ intestines!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_04_echo_Angel.wav=Well, that was...needlessly graphic.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_05_echo_Angel.wav=This is unusual -- the Firehawk has harrassed the Bloodshots for some time, but they have never mounted such a large-scale assault on the Firehawk before. I wonder what’s given them such confidence?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_06_echo_Flanksteak.wav=Keep goin, Bloodshots! That demonic...THING will rue the goddamn day it messed with us! We’re gonna make The Firehawk  choke to death on his own feces!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_06a_echo_Angel.wav=Dude. Ew.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_07_echo_Jack.wav=Lemme explain something. Even if you DO rescue Roland from this Firehawk guy, the Crimson Raiders ain’t exactly long for this world. (beat) You know what? I think you deserve a little hint: my secret involves your pathetic resistance dying, and me laughing, a lot.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_08_echo_Jack.wav=Feel that? The sound of those earthquakes marks my drills getting closer and closer to the vault. That's the sound of progress, baby!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_09_echo_Angel.wav=This is it -- the Firehawk’s hideout. Be careful, friend: there are bound to be traps everywhere.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_10_echo_Jack.wav=You think the Firehawk’s got Roland, huh? (beat) Y’know, I heard the Firehawk liquifies bandits and drinks ‘em like flesh smoothies. But nah, I’m sure your bandit pal Roland’s just fine. Of course, if Roland hadn’t been such a dumbass in the first place, he -- whoops. Almost spilled my secret. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_11_echoX_BloodshotBandit.wav=OH GOD IN HEAVEN, I CAN TASTE MY OWN MELTING FLESH!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_12_echo_Angel.wav=See? Traps. Don’t let that happen to you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep5_Pt4_13_echoX_Lilith.wav=Could you help me up?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_01_echo_Lilith.wav=Alright, killer, I’m back in Sanctuary.  Be Careful – the Bloodshots have camped out all around the dam.  You’ll wanna get a vehicle to soak up some bullets for you--
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_01b_echo_Lilith.wav=I’m talking to someone, Scooter.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_01c_echo_Scooter.wav=Man, you are the FOURTH hottest corpse I have ever seen!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_01d_echo_Lilith.wav=Hunh -- nobody seems to be around. Just drive up and honk your horn -- maybe this won't be so hard after all.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_01h_echo_Bandit.wav=Buzz off -- nobody comes in or out without the boss sayin' so.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_02b_echo_Scooter.wav=Finally Made it to the Dust, huh?  You been off the Echo fer hours, thought you mighta got brained or something.  But you ain’t, so yay…and stuff.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_10_EchoX_Ellie.wav=Tryin' ta rescue your pal Roland from the dam, huh? I betcha could fool those Bloodshots if you drove up in one of their custom trucks. I got one right over yonder that I…
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_11_EchoX_Ellie.wav=Crushed with the driver still inside.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_12_EchoX_Ellie.wav=My bad. Well, I got a vanilla technical in the shop and most of the parts we need. Just gotta doll it up with the some more bandit trimmin’s -- spikes, blood, skulls, that kinda thing. You could probably scavenge that stuff from the bandit patrols around here.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_13_EchoX_Ellie.wav=You be careful out there, cutie!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_14_EchoX_Ellie.wav=You’ll haveta blow up some bandit cars and grab the crap from the wreckage. And don’t pay 'em any mind if they start callin’ ya names  -- just makes killin’ em that much more fun!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_15_Echo_Scooter.wav=So, you an’ my sister are gettin’ along pretty well, huh? That’s cool. Course, if ya make fun of the way she looks I’ll have to tie you to a vending machine and set you on fire, but it’s cool that you guys are hangin’ out. It’s cool. It's fine.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_17b_echo_Ellie.wav=Just finished preppin' my truck for those bandit parts. Just get a few more and we'll be good to go.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_17c_echo_Lilith.wav=Almost got a bandit car? Roland can handle whatever the Bloodshots dish out, but I generally don't like letting him get tortured any longer than I have to.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_18_Echo_Ellie.wav=You got the parts? Great! Just bring 'em back and we’ll git you rollin’!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt1_19_EchoX_Ellie.wav=Alright, lookin' good! Now we just gotta get it in the catch-a-ride system.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt2_04_Echo_Scooter.wav=Well I see that. Everybody said you were dead--shit, Roland said you were dead. Damn, if you ain't the fourth hottest corpse I ever seen. Wanna hear the others? Boom. Here we go. One: Commandant Steele. Two: TK Baha. Great taste in shirts. Three: this kid I knew named Franky-Frank who jumped out a building?

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt2_12a_echo_Lilith.wav=I've spent the last few months keeping the Bloodshots away from Sanctuary -- be careful. They're a few bullets short of a full mag, but what they lack in brains, they make up for in violence.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt2_12b_Echo_Flanksteak.wav=Okay, Hyperion -- a hundred thousand bucks for Roland! Final offer! ECHO me back and let's negotiate, already!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_01_echo_Jack.wav=You didn’t know where Roland was, you don’t know why I’m after the Vault, and you still don’t know my awesome little secret -- god, it’s embarrassing how far behind you guys are. I mean, I don't wanna rub it in, or anything, but...damn.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_04_echoX_Ellie.wav=Crap. Hey, sweetie -- I’ll need ya to get rid of that runner you’re drivin’. You can use my car crusher if ya want.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_05_echoX_Ellie.wav=Or you could ride it off a cliff, blast it to bits, or drive it into a bandit camp -- I just need it blowed up so's it ain’t in the Catch-a-Ride system. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_06_echoX_Ellie.wav=Thanks for takin’ care of that -- I can get yer car into the catch-a-ride system now.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_07_Echo_Jack.wav=Look at those murderous Bloodshots. Don’t you think Pandora would be better without their scum? That’s all I wanna do -- clean up this planet. If that means I’ve gotta kill bandits like you, like the Bloodshots -- like all those Crimson Raider idiots in Sanctuary? Hell -- I’m happy to do it.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_08_echo_Lilith.wav=You handling the Bloodshots alright? They’ve been trying to take Roland out ever since he kicked their asses out of Sanctuary. (angrily sighing) I shoulda seen it coming.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_09_echo_Lilith.wav=The resistance needs the info Roland gathered on the Vault. We know Hyperion wants it opened, but we don’t know why. If you rescue Roland, we might have a shot at stopping Jack.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_10_echo_Lilith.wav=Security’s getting tighter -- Roland must be nearby. Keep at it, you’re doing great.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_11_echo_Lilith.wav=Watch out -- they’ve got a badass!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_12_echo_Lilith.wav=Woah -- I’ve never seen anybody take down one of the Bloodshot’s badasses so quickly. I can see why Roland wanted you in the Raiders so badly.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_13_echo_Lilith.wav=Saw the way you handled that last mob of bad guys -- my compliments. I can see why Roland wanted you in the Raiders so badly.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_14_echo_Lilith.wav=Keep your eyes open -- Roland’s gotta be around here somewhere!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_15_live_Roland.wav=Vault Hunter! Good to finally meet you in person. Hell of a job fighting through those bloodshots --
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_17_live_Roland.wav=Rrgh -- damnit!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_18_echoX_Roland.wav=Meet me in Sanctuary -- it’s time to strike back.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_19_echo_Lilith.wav=That bot's taking Roland to the drop-barge! Stop them before they get away!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_20_echo_Lilith.wav=You're at the dam -- just drive up to the gate and honk your horn.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_21_echoX_Roland.wav=I'm over here!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_22_echoX_Roland.wav=I could use some help!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep6_Pt4_23_echoX_Roland.wav=This way, soldier!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_01_live_Lilith.wav=How the hell did those bandits snag you, anyway?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_02_live_Roland.wav=I was taking a leak and one of them knocked me out.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_03_live_Lilith.wav=Wow. You are a dumbass.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_04_live_Roland.wav=Yep. I, uh…yeah. (awkward laugh) Total dumbass.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_05_live_Lilith.wav=I was joking, dude. I'm happy to see you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_06_live_Roland.wav=Oh. Thanks.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_07_live_Lilith.wav=...This is where you say you're happy to see me, too.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_08_live_Roland.wav=Oh. Right. I'm, uh -- it's good to see you?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_09_live_Lilith.wav=Smooth.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_10_echoX_Roland.wav=Handsome Jack is going to kill us all unless you can stop him.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11_echoX_Lilith.wav=He means, "hi." That's his way of saying "hi."
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11a_echoX_Roland.wav=Right. Sorry. Hi. I'll be honest, soldier: we’re losing this war. We've been trying to stop Jack for years -- taking out his men, raiding his Eridium mines -- but it hasn't been enough. But you -- you met Jack and lived. You fought off the Rippers and the Bloodshots -- saved my ass and Lilith’s.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11b_echoX_Lilith.wav=Thanks, by the way.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11c_echoX_Roland.wav=If we're going to survive this, we need your help, vault hunter. Now: we thought Jack wanted to open a Vault and use its power to wipe us off Pandora. But thanks to some intel I stole from a Hyperion convoy, I found out...we were wrong.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11d_echoX_Lilith.wav=What?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11e_echoX_Roland.wav=He’s not going to open a vault. He’s going to control it.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11f_echoX_Lilith.wav=I’ll just go ahead and repeat myself: ...what?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11g_echoX_Roland.wav=The Vault Jack’s looking for isn’t an alien prison, or a cache of weapons. It’s a living thing. An ancient, Eridian Warrior, powerful enough to destroy all life on Pandora. Whoever awakens it, gets to control it. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11h_echoX_Lilith.wav=That sounds...bad.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11i_echoX_Roland.wav=If Jack wakes the Warrior, yeah. But if we control the Warrior first--
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_11j_echoX_Lilith.wav=...We could use it to wipe Hyperion off the map. Alright, I’m likin’ this plan.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_12_echoX_Roland.wav=--There’s a problem. We need the Vault Key to wake the Warrior. And Jack’s already got it. But if you’ve spoken to Tannis --
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_13_echoX_Lilith.wav=-- She didn’t vomit when she saw you, did she? She does that, sometimes. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_14_echoX_Roland.wav=She might've told you the key needs to be charged with Eridium. We're racing against time -- every ounce of that stuff Jack mines from the ground puts him closer to taking control of that warrior and wiping us out. We've gotta get our hands on the vault key. Now, if anybody knows where the key's being kept,  it's my spy out in Tundra Express. He's as good at gathering intel as he is at drinking. So I'm sure he's sleeping off last night's booze right now  -- you'll need to get a fire weapon to wake him up. I'll explain when you get out there.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_15_echoX_Lilith.wav=Which means we gotta kill him.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_17_echoX_Roland.wav=I had it, Marcus. I had it in my hand.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_18_echoX_Marcus.wav=What, the Vault Key? Then maybe you shouldn’t have sold it to Tannis! If you’d given it to your old pal Marcus, maybe we wouldn’t be in this situation!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_19_echoX_Lilith.wav=I had it, Marcus. I had it in my hand.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_20_echoX_Brick.wav=I had it, Marcus. I had it in my hand.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt1_21_echoX_Mordecai.wav=I had it, Marcus. I had it in my hand.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01_echo_Roland.wav=You’ll have to signal our man -- I’d bet anything he’s sleeping off a hangover, so you’ll have to wake him up. The sound of some Varkids burning alive at the same time oughtta do it. You got a fire gun, right?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01a_echo_Roland.wav=The Varkids won't make that screechin' noise unless you burn them.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01b_echo_Roland.wav=You've got to set the Varkids on fire to wake our man up.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01c_echo_Roland.wav=If you don't set 'em on fire, the varkids won't screech our man out of his hangover.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01d_echo_Roland.wav=You gotta find a fire weapon to get those Varkids screeching.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01e_echo_Roland.wav=Don't forget -- you gotta set the Varkids on fire, or they won't screech our man out of bed.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01f_echo_Roland.wav=Keep goin -- set a few more Varkids on fire.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01g_echo_Roland.wav=Good job burnin' those varkids, but you have to keep them on fire at the same time or their screeches won't be loud enough.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01h_echo_Roland.wav=You gotta burn a bunch of them, at the same time, to wake our man up.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01i_echo_Roland.wav=That's a lot of toasted varkids, but they gotta be burning at the same time.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01j_echo_Roland.wav=There aren't enough bugs to burn now. You'll have to stir the Varkid's nest -- turn on those thumpers.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01k_echo_Roland.wav=Good goin' -- here they come!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01l_echo_Roland.wav=They sound angry. Get ready to start burnin' em!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01m_echo_Roland.wav=Turn on those thumpers to rile up some more Varkids.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01n_echo_Roland.wav=If you don't have a fire weapon, Marcus might sell 'em.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01o_echo_Roland.wav=If you still need a fire weapon, you might be able to buy one from a vending machine.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01p_echo_Roland.wav=Hey -- I just found an old fire weapon I had lying around. Come back to my place and it's yours.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01q_echo_Roland.wav=Now you should be able to burn some Varkids. Good hunting.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01s_echo_Roland.wav=I stashed a fire weapon in one of the snowmen, if you need it. Just shoot the snowman in the head and you'll get your gun.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01t_echo_Roland.wav=Those fire melons in the area oughtta help you burn those varkids. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_01u_echo_Roland.wav=A friend of mine set up some fire traps -- they could help you torch the varkids.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_02_echo_Roland.wav=Well done. Now set some more on fire before that one dies.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_03_live_Mordecai.wav=Rrrghh...SHUT UP ALREADY!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_04_live_Mordecai.wav=So loud, so angry...
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_05_live_Mordecai.wav=…So dead.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_06_echo_Roland.wav=Looks like Mordecai sent us a message.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_07_echo_Mordecai.wav=(yawning) Hey, Vault Hunter -- welcome to the Crimson Raiders. Sorry you had to wake me up -- I mighta celebrated a little too hard last night after Bloodwing and I raided a Hyperion convoy. Ain’t that right, Blood?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_07a_echo_Mordecai.wav=Watch out for those tripwires, ese.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_07b_echo_Mordecai.wav=Careful -- you gotta sneak up on that mine to disarm it. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_08_echo_Roland.wav=Without the vault key, Jack can’t control the Warrior -- you’ve gotta hijack that train, soldier. My old friend Tina can help; go talk to her.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_08a_echo_Angel.wav=Roland has the right idea. If you don’t hijack that train, Sanctuary will fall.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_08b_echo_Mordecai.wav=Ohhhohoho my god. Sorry, I was just watchin’ you fight and the look on that last guy’s face when you shot him -- it was priceless. I like you, man. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_08c_echo_Mordecai.wav=Hey, amigo -- I’m sending my bird Bloodwing down to help ya out. Go get ‘em, Blood!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_08d_echo_Mordecai.wav=That’s my girl!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_09_echo_Mordecai.wav=Hey -- now that I’m up, I can help ya out. Just spot a target by settin’ em on fire and I’ll blast ‘em.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_10_echo_Roland .wav=Tina’s a bombmaker and a friend of mine -- I've saved her life a few times, and she's saved mine even more. She'll help you, but here's a tip: don't make any sudden movements near her.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_12_echo_Mordecai.wav=Uhhh…did the ground just move -- am I still drunk?

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_12c_echo_Mordecai.wav=I stunned Wilhelm -- get him!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_13_echo_Bloodwing.wav=(Squawk!)
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt2_14_echo_Mordecai.wav=Hehe. Easy, girl. So -- a Hyperion train is speedin’ through the Tundra Express. If my intel’s good, and it usually is, the vault key itself might be onboard. My advice? Do what I'd do -- steal the key. Get drunk. Pass out.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt3_24a_echo_Angel.wav=Wilhelm nearly defeated the other Vault Hunters a couple of years ago. You have proven yourself to be even stronger than them. Well done.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt3_24b_echo_Angel.wav=Wilhelm dropped a power core. Be sure to grab it -- my sensors tell me it is one-of-a-kind. If you bring it to Roland, Sanctuary’s shields may never need to be recharged again.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt3_24c_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Sorry about the bad intel, everybody. I really thought the vault key would be on that train. I’ll make it up to you all later -- next time I’m in Sanctuary, the beers are on me. Whatcha think, Bloodwing?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt3_24d_echoX_Bloodwing.wav=Squawk!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt3_25_echo_Roland.wav=Nice job! Get that power core to Van Owen -- he’ll know what to do.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt3_26_echo_VanOwen.wav=Whatcha got there?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt3_27_echo_Jack.wav=(sarcastic) Wow. Bravo. Champagne. Cheers. High-five. Slow clap. You got the damn power core, didn’t you? (beat) You’ve been warned, the kid gloves are coming off. Tighten up the big-boy pants because things are gonna get really bad for you Vault Hunters.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_01_echoX_Mordecai.wav=BOOM!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_02_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Take THAT!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_03_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Gotcha, pendejo!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_14_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Thank you, thank you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_15_echoX_Mordecai.wav=I got him!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_16_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Taking the shot!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_17_echoX_Mordecai.wav=I'll take him out!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_18_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Vault hunter! NO!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_19_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Watch out, amigo!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_20_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Be careful!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_21_echoX_Mordecai.wav=You alright?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_22_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Get behind something!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_23_echoX_Mordecai.wav=No! Get up!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_24_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Another notch on my rifle. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_25_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Not bad.  Not bad.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_26_echoX_Mordecai.wav=I don't think he liked me!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_27_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Nothing like a challenging kill.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_28_live_Lilith.wav=How you holding up?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_29_live_Roland.wav=Corporal Reiss is dead, the Bloodshots broke two of my ribs, and if we don’t find a new power core, Sanctuary’s shield will be down within days.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_30_live_Lilith.wav=So...better than usual?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_31_live_Roland.wav=Yeah, it’s been a good week. (beat) What do you think about the new vault hunter?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_32_live_Lilith.wav=Far as I can tell? Just what the Raiders need -- strong, well-armed, way better looking than most vault hunters--
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_33_live_Roland.wav=...I’m trying not to be offended.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_34_live_Lilith.wav=Oh, grow a pair. You’re the one who left.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_35_live_Roland.wav=Anything else you noticed about the vault hunter?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_36_live_Lilith.wav=Uh, just that they’re eavesdropping on us. (beat) Right now. (beat) Hi, vault hunter.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_37_live_TinyTina.wav=(making a song out of it) Runnin’ runnin’ runnin’, I’m runnin’ over here. Run-run-run-run run.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_38_echo_Roland.wav=I know Tina can be…odd, but she's the most gifted demolitions expert on Pandora. Just do what she asks, and I guarantee she'll help you hijack the train and get the vault key.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_39_live_MushySnuggleBites.wav=I love you so much you will DIE.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_40_live_FeliciaSexopants.wav=You smell like a beautiful corpse!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_41_echo_Roland.wav=Woah -- never seen a power core like that. The one you got from Reiss has nearly burnt out -- why don’t you bring that one back here? We may not have found the vault key, but at least Sanctuary will be safe a little longer thanks to you.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_42_echoX_LtDavis.wav=A new power core? Woah -- that looks like it could keep our shields up for months -- years, even!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_43_echoX_TinyTina.wav=That's right, bitches  -- my big brudder's about to teach you some MANNERS. Nobody steals Mushy Snugglebites' badonkadonk and lives!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep7_Pt4_43a_echoX_BoomingVoiceBandit.wav=WHO THE HELL IS MUSHY SNUGGLEBITES?!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_01_EchoX_VanOwen.wav=As much as I hate using Hyperion tech, that core you found could keep our shields up permanently. Pop out that old core -- it’s nearly burnt out anyway.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_02_EchoX_VanOwen.wav=Now, slam that core in harder than a shiv into a Truxican’s sternum. Sorry -- old Crimson Lance saying.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_03_EchoX_VanOwen.wav=Okay, I think we are in bus--
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_03a_echo_HypFemale.wav=Hyperion Uplink Established. Awaiting Commands.

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_04b_Echo_Angel.wav=Executing phase shift.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_05_EchoX_VanOwen.wav=The shields are down! The shields are down!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_06_Echo_Jack.wav=Nicely done, Angel! Now -- let’s kill ourselves some vault hunters.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_06a_Echo_Jack.wav=Oh, I’m sorry. Was that your shields that just went down? So you knew that I knew, you were going for the power core -- and you just plugged it in? Even for you guys, that’s pretty -- ah, man, that’s pretty stupid. (beat) I told you, I always win.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_07_Echo_Angel.wav=I'm... so sorry.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_08_EchoX_VanOwen.wav=That wasn’t a power core! RUN!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_09_Echo_Roland.wav=What the hell? Did something just get through the shield?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_10_Echo_scooter.wav=Shield's down, Roland! Oh, man, somebody start getting everybody underground. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_11_Echo_Lilith.wav=Everybody! I've got a really bad idea! Scooter, get Sanctuary in the air! Roland, get me some Eridium!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_11a_echo_Lilith.wav=We don't have a choice, Scooter!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_12_Echo_lilith.wav=Not with the city stuck like this --
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_13_Echo_roland.wav=Soldier, get to the engine tower! Scooter, get us in the air -- come on, let's go! Move it!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_14_EchoX_Scooter.wav=Meet me in the center of town, now! I’ma need your help real bad!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt1_15_EchoX_Scooter.wav=Pretty sure we can't do that without killing everyone in the city. It ain't ready to fly, Lily!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_01_Echo_Jack.wav=I love the way you vault hunters just up and trusted Angel. Never occured to you that she was working for me, did it? I did the same thing to the last four vault hunters, but I’ll be entirely honest -- tricking you guys this time? Way funnier.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_02_Echo_Jack.wav=Hey, thanks for taking the bait and grabbing that power core. It was hard to concentrate on charging the Vault Key, what with Roland’s buddies attacking my Eridium mines.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_03_Echo_Scooter.wav=Okay, if we cycle the ignition primers, it'll get us somewhere!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_04_Echo_Scooter.wav=Alright, I got this one -- all's you gotta do is hit the last switch!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_05_Echo_Scooter.wav=(grunt of exertion) Alright, primers are shorting! Keep goin'!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_05a_Echo_Scooter.wav=Alright, we're primed! Everybody get ready!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_06_Echo_Jack.wav=I told you guys -- the hero always wins.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_07_Echo_Roland.wav=Heroes don’t murder children, Jack.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_08_Echo_Jack.wav=Oh, get over it. I shot ONE baby. And, in fairness, it was being a dick.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_09_Echo_Roland.wav=Ah, you son of a--
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_10_Echo_Roland.wav=I'm pinned, soldier -- I can't get the Eridium to Lilith! Get to me, quick!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt2_11_Echo_lilith.wav=I need that Eridium! Get to Roland!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_01_Echo_Lilith.wav=Roland? Baby, come on, you’re alive, I know it. Roland!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_02_echoX_Roland.wav=Don't worry about me! Grab as much Eridium as you can carry. Get it to Lilith!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_03_Echo_Lilith.wav=You've got the Eridium? I need it -- get to the center of town!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_03a_Echo_Lilith.wav=Gimme the Eridium!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_04_Echo_Lilith.wav=I’ve never used this much. You might wanna hang onto something.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_05_Echo_Lilith.wav=Sorry, kid. That was an accident. I’ll see you on the other side, though, I promise. Hit it, Scooter!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_06_Echo_Scooter.wav=This is one them moments. (Deep breath) CATCH A RIIIIDE!!!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_07_Echo_Jack.wav=That’s the best you got? A flying city? What could you chumps POSSIBLY have that makes you think you’ve got a chance against me?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_08_Echo_Roland.wav=A Siren.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_09_Echo_Lilith.wav=Sup.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_10_Echo_Jack.wav=Hm.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_11_Echo_Angel.wav=I know you’re angry at me right now, but we don’t have a lot of time. I’ll explain everything -- just get to The Fridge -- it's the only way to reach the Highlands. I detect Lilith might have phased your city there.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_12_Echo_Angel.wav=You’ll be able to reconnect with your friends after you get through the Fridge.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt3_13_Echo_Angel.wav=We're not friends anymore, are we?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_01_echoX_DrZed.wav=I'll see to the wounded, but you gotta get us outta here first!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_02_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=If this is the end, Vault Hunter, let me say -- it was a pleasure to have known you!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_03_echoX_Scooter.wav=Oh man, you best get movin', else we gonna die!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_04_echoX_Roland.wav=Move, move!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_06_echoX_Moxxi.wav=What the hell's going on out there?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_07_echoX_Marcus.wav=The hell are you doing in here? Get out there and do something!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_08_echoX_PatriciaTannis.wav=While I thank you for the inquisitive prodding, do please get the hell away from me as we’re being BOMBARDED BY EXPLOSIVES. Most appreciative.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_09_echoX_LtDavis.wav=As much as I hate using Hyperion tech, that core you brought us earlier is nearly burnt up. Why doncha pop it out?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_10_echoX_LtDavis.wav=Now, shove in that new core you found harder than a shiv into a Truxican’s sternum. Sorry -- old Crimson Lance saying.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_11_echoX_LtDavis.wav=Okay, I think we are in bus--
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_11a_echo_Jack.wav=You know, I think it’s finally time to tell you that little secret.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_11b_echo_Jack.wav=Angel's working for me.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_12_echoX_LtDavis.wav=What the hell --
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_13_echoX_LtDavis.wav=That’s not a power core. Raiders, the shields are down, the shields --
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_14_echoX_Roland.wav=You’ve got your orders, Scooter -- MOVE!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_15_echo_Angel.wav=The door’s frozen? Son of a...witch. Let me melt the ice -- once you get through the fridge, you’ll be able to reconnect with your friends on the other side.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep8_Pt4_16_echo_Jack.wav=You only survived our train ride together because I wanted you to. Five years ago, Roland and his friends opened the Vault because Angel and I tricked them into doing it. Everything you vault hunters have ever done -- (laughing) it's all part of my plan. I'm such a rock star.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_01_echo_Angel.wav=I’ve been following Jack’s orders from the beginning. Jack modified that power core you found to have a Hyperion Network uplink. Through it, I was able to access Sanctuary’s defenses and lower them. It was all... part of Jack’s plan. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_01a_echo_Jack.wav=I learned a lot from observing Pandora. Learned a lot about survival. About greed. But most of all? I learned no matter how badass they may be, anyone will happily lay down their life for a pretty girl, with big, blue eyes.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_01b_echo_Jack.wav=Shame that Wilhelm had to let you kill him. Heck of a soldier -- not many people would volunteer to die, just so you'd think I didn't want you to have that power core. But -- psst -- spoilers: I did.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_01c_echo_Jack.wav=So, Wilhelm nearly killed your Vault Hunter friends a couple years ago, and you just blow him away like any other grunt? Yeah, that's cause I poisoned him before you guys fought. Worth it, though, to make you think I didn't want you to have that power core. But -- psst -- spoilers: I did.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_01d_echo_Jack.wav=You're kinda pissing me off, kiddo. You trusted Angel and fell for my trap just like your idiot friends did five years ago. But you -- you were supposed to help Angel and I destroy Sanctuary. But you didn’t. Sanctuary’s still safe. Which makes killing you…my top priority. Congratulations.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_02_echo_Angel.wav=Five years ago, I tricked Roland and his friends into opening the Vault. I told them it was to protect Pandora from a great evil. That was a lie. Jack knew he could make a fortune off the Eridium held within the Vault, but he was too much of a coward to open it himself. Through me, he got the vault hunters to do his dirty work. (sigh). I am so tired of manipulating people...
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_02a_echo_Angel.wav=All these years, I told myself Jack had the planet’s best interests in mind. But what he just had me do to Sanctuary? To people he had never met, who had never done anything to him? He’s not a hero. He’s a murderer. And I won’t be his puppet anymore.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_03_echo_Angel.wav=Without you, Pandora has no hope. You have no reason to trust me. I get that. But if you’re going to stop Jack from controlling the Warrior, you’ll need my help. Because I know where the key is. It’s with me.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_05_echo_Angel.wav=I’m sensing something big  -- your friends might be around here somewhere.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_05a_echo_Angel.wav=Son of a -- witch. The door's iced over. Let me help you with that.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_06_echo_Lilith.wav=Annnnd...I’m awesome. Hey, killer. I phased the city. No big deal. Find a way back here quick as you can.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_07_echo_Scooter.wav=I got the shields back up, yo! We should be safe as houses. You can thank me later.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_08_echo_Angel.wav=I've found a way to get you back to Sanctuary -- head to the Hyperion Extraction plant nearby.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_09_echo_Scooter.wav=Woah woah woah, fingerlicker! Don't be bustin' holes in my ride!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_10_echo_Angel.wav=If you can cross the river and steal a supply beacon, we can get Sanctuary back onto the fast-travel network. I promise. ...Little as I’m sure that means right now.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_10a_echo_Angel.wav=Darn -- that exploder took out the bridge controls. Find another way across the river!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_10b_echo_Angel.wav=I'm detecting a cargo mover in the area -- that may help you cross the river.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_10c_echo_Angel.wav=Use the cargo mover to get across the river.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_11_echo_HypFemale.wav=Lunar supply drop incoming. Please take cover.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_12_echo_HypFemale.wav=Lunar supply drop complete. As you were.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_13_echo_Angel.wav=That’s why we’re here! If you can get the moonbase to drop you a fast-travel station, you can use it to link back up with Sanctuary. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_13a_echo_Angel.wav=Did that Thresher just eat the beacon? Uh...you'll need that back.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_14_echo_Lilith.wav=Hunh. Well,  we've got no plan to stop Jack, but at least the quakes from his drills aren’t shaking the city anymore. Silver linings, you know?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_15_echo_Roland.wav=I can't believe Jack was controlling the Angel all along. We almost got killed opening the Vault, JUST so we could bring that sonofabitch into power.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt1_16_echo_Lilith.wav=Well, now we're almost-getting-killed JUST to get him out of power. Nice to know some things never change.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_01_echo_Angel.wav=You'll need a quiet place to set up the beacon. Head to the town of Overlook. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_01a_echo_Angel.wav=This is perfect -- the townsfolk are too terrified of Jack's grinder to disturb us.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_01b_echo_Angel.wav=(torture scream lasting about 2 seconds)
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_01c_echo_Angel.wav=(torture scream lasting about 2 seconds, through gritted teeth)
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_01d_echo_Angel.wav=(torture scream lasting about 2 seconds, with a sob in it)
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_02_echo_Angel.wav=You'll wanna set up the beacon over there -- once the moonbase processes our request, you should have a fast-travel station.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_03_echo_Angel.wav=It's transmitting the supply request now. Now we've just gotta wait a few minutes and --
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_04_echo_Jack.wav=Angel. That’s enough. You can stop pretending to help the bad guys now. Angel?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_05_echo_Angel.wav=AGH!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_06_echo_Angel.wav=They're coming to stop the transmission. You have to defend the beacon.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_07_echo_HypFemale.wav=Uncalibrated fast-travel station request received. Estimated processing time: [three to six weeks.]
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_08_echo_Angel.wav=No! No no no -- I'll move some data around, see if I can bump you up in the queue.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_09_echo_Jack.wav=What did I just SAY?!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_10_echo_Angel.wav=I've increased your request's priority -- T-Bone Junction can live without medical supplies for another few months.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_11_echo_Jack.wav=See, this is what I don't get about you bad guys. You know the hero's gonna win, but you never just die quickly-- man, this one guy in New Haven, right? City's burning, people dying, blah blah blah. This guy rushes me with a spoon. A fricking spoon. And I'm just laughing. So I scoop out his eyeballs with it, and his kids are all, "aghhhhh!,” and, ah...you had to be there. Anyway, the moral is: you're a bitch.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_12_echo_Angel.wav=God...darnit. The lunar engineers denied our request -- I'll see what I can do.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_13_echo_Angel.wav=I just shut off the moonbase's oxygen supply. I expect the engineers will launch your fast-travel station very soon.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_14_echo_Angel.wav=They're launching the fast-travel station now! Nothing gets results like a death threat.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_15_echo_Angel.wav=It’s almost here -- just protect the beacon for another few seconds...
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_15a_echo_Jack.wav=God dammit, Angel! What are you doing?! Those are the bad guys!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_16_echo_Angel.wav=The fast-travel has landed! Use it, and get back to Roland! He'll need your help to shut me down!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_17_echo_Jack.wav=(rage) Run all you want, bandit. We all know how this is gonna end. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_18_echo_Angel.wav=They’ve damaged the beacon -- repair it!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_19_echo_Angel.wav=You’ve gotta repair the beacon or the supply drop will never arrive!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_31_echo_Angel.wav=You’ve got to repair the beacon.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_32_echo_Angel.wav=You can’t get back to Sanctuary if you don’t repair that beacon!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_33_echo_Jack.wav=Wow. You’re really bad at protecting that beacon.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_34_echo_Jack.wav=What makes you think you can take me down if you can’t even repair that beacon?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_35_echo_Jack.wav=The beacon’s damaged, kiddo. And that’s why you’re gonna die here.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_36_echo_Angel.wav=I’m accessing Overlook’s computer grid. I bet I can find something to help you!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_37_echo_Angel.wav=I’ve gotten the defensive guns online!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_38_echo_Angel.wav=I’m opening the Overlook armory! Head there for an ammo refill!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_39_echo_Angel.wav=I'm moonshotting you some supplies!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_39a_echo_Angel.wav=I'm sending more supplies via moonshot!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_39b_echo_Angel.wav=I'm sending more supplies your way!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_40_echo_Angel.wav=Jack had an old network of landmines set up around here. I’m revealing them, but you have to activate them!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_41_echo_Angel.wav=I’m filling up Overlook’s reserve fuel tanks. Stand way back before you shoot them!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt2_42_echo_Angel.wav=I’ve found a distress signal for the old Overlook air force. Set it off if you need backup!

Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_02_echoX_Lilith.wav=That's his way of saying, "Wow, you're a badass. I'm glad you're okay."
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_03_echoX_Roland.wav=Right. Sorry. We'd all be dead if it weren't for you. But we need a plan. Jack’s getting closer and closer to digging up the Warrior, and we still don’t know where he’s got that vault key stashed.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_04_echoX_Angel.wav=I can help you with that.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_04a_echoX_Roland.wav=You?! Dammit, we told you never to contact us again!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_04b_echoX_Angel.wav=Will you please just hear me out -- 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_05_echoX_Lilith.wav=Sure, let’s listen to the crazy computer that just tried to kill us. Hey, remember that time she told us the Vault was full of loot? 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_06_echoX_Roland.wav=Ah, the good ol' days.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_07_echoX_Angel.wav=--It’s with me! I’m charging the vault key!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_08_echoX_roland.wav=Continue.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_09_echoX_Angel.wav=The key naturally charges itself once every two hundred years. Jack is patient, but he’s not that patient -- he’s been using my power to forcibly charge the key with Eridium. If you find me, you find the Vault Key.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_10_echoX_Angel.wav=The Vault Key is housed in my AI Control Core atop Thousand Cuts. It's protected by three impassable security hurdles.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_11_echoX_Angel.wav=The first is a competitor deterrence field that will obliterate any non-Hyperion entity passing through it.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_12_echoX_Angel.wav=Beyond that lies the second hurdle: a defense bunker outfitted with the most high-tech weaponry Hyperion can afford.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_14_echoX_Angel.wav=This will be your only opportunity to steal the vault key and stop Jack from controlling the Warrior. I’m out of time -- do what you will, but promise me this: no matter what happens -- do not allow Lilith into my chambers.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_15_echoX_Lilith.wav=What the hell’s that supposed to mean?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_16_echoX_Roland.wav=If she was luring us into a trap, she would have made it sound a little bit possible.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_17_echoX_Lilith.wav=If we’re taking that bitch down, I’m coming -- trap or not.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_18_echoX_Roland.wav=If anyone’s going to shut her down, it has to be you, soldier. Head to the Hyperion Preserve -- I think I know how to get past the first hurdle.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt4_19_echoX_Angel.wav=If you manage to get past both of those obstacles, you’ll have to get through the final hurdle: a door that will only open for Handsome Jack. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_01_live_Rat.wav=Pisssss off, stranger!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_03_live_Roland.wav=The city may be safe right now, but what happens if Hyperion launches another barrage? We’ve got no shield.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_04_live_Lilith.wav=Ah. Good point. Lemme get on the ECHO.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_05_echoX_Lilith.wav=Listen up, Hyperion! If you’ve got any bright ideas to blast Sanctuary out of the sky, just remember -- I can phase the city anywhere I want at the drop of a hat. But, if you wanna waste another few billion dollars launching mortars at us, be my guest.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_06_live_Lilith.wav=Well, that’s that taken care of.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_07_live_Roland.wav=Well done. Was, uh...was any of that true?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_08_live_Lilith.wav=What? Hell no. It’s a miracle I didn’t phase us into a mountain.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_09_echo_Angel.wav=Now that Sanctuary’s reappeared, you can use any fast-travel station to get back to the Crimson Raiders. I’ll mark the nearest one on your ECHO device.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_10_echo_RoboticVoice.wav=Error. Location  [Sanctuary] Not found.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_11_echo_Angel.wav=Oh, no -- the phaseblast must have taken Sanctuary off the fast-travel network. Uh...okay. Head to the Eridium Extraction Plant nearby. I think I know how to get you back to your friends.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_12_echo_Angel.wav=Do you see those lunar supply shots? We need to steal a lunar supply beacon and get the moonbase to send you an uncalibrated fast-travel unit. You can use that to get Sanctuary back on the fast-travel network. Simple. Except not at all.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_13_echo_Angel.wav=You’ve got the beacon? Good -- we can use that to request an uncalibrated fast-travel unit from the moonbase. (beat) You’ll need a quiet place to set up the beacon. Head to the town of Overlook. Thanks to Hyperion’s mining operations, the people of Overlook suffer from the skull-shivers. They won’t disturb us.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_14_echo_Mordecai.wav=You found Overlook, huh? Used to be a nice little town, until Hyperion took over. Now everybody there’s got the skull shivers thanks to Jack’s mining operations. Poor bastards are too sick to leave their homes.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_15_echo_Angel.wav=We don’t have long until Jack realizes I’m not helping him anymore. Defend that beacon!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_16_echo_Angel.wav=The fast-travel has landed! Gimme a second while I calibrate it to Sanctuary’s new position!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_17_echo_Jack.wav=Angel, what the hell are you doing?!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_18_echo_RoboticVoice.wav=Fast travel station calibrated. Location [Sanctuary] is now available for travel. 
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_19_echo_Angel.wav=Go, quickly -- use the fast-travel station and get back to Sanctuary!
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_20_echo_Jack.wav=(rage) Angel, you and I are gonna have a serious talk.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_21_echoX_Lilith.wav="Competitor deterrence field"? What, like, a death wall?
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_22_echoX_Angel.wav=It is a field of pure thermosonic energy programmed to atomize any unauthorized personnel.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_23_echoX_Roland.wav=So, yeah. A death wall.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_24_echo_Angel.wav=Before you can think about getting the vault key, we need to find Sanctuary. I’m detecting something big  -- your friends might be around here somewhere.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_25_echo_Angel.wav=You know, I didn’t lie to you about everything. You really are the only person who can stop Jack. Roland, Lilith, and Mordecai -- he defeated them long ago. They can help you reach him, but in the end...it will be you who brings Jack down.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_26_echoX_Roland.wav=That doesn't sound good.
Voices\English(US)\VO_Ep9_Pt5_27_echoX_Lilith.wav=That sounds even worse.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ArmsDealing_03a_echoX_Zed.wav=Ooh -- that arm's lookin' good. He musta worked out.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ArmsDealing_03b_echoX_Zed.wav=That arm musta belonged to a seamstress or somethin'. You can tell from the metatarsels.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ArmsDealing_03c_echoX_Zed.wav=You nearly got 'em all, just keep hustlin'!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ArmsDealing_05_echoX_Zed.wav=Now those are some pristine limbs -- well done!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ArmsDealing_06_echoX_Zed.wav=There's a joke somewhere about how those cost me an arm and a leg. I can't thinka one right now, but I could sell those for a fortune.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_AsstheAss_01_echoX_Roland.wav=This is a recorded message to any Crimson Raiders in the area -- Sanctuary has been targeted by four Hyperion spies masquerading as bandits. They're hiding out in Three Horns -- find 'em, kill 'em, and see if you can figure out why they're here.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_AsstheAss_02_echo_Jack.wav=Alright, you mindless gun-hands: you're looking for a really hot chick with blue tattoos and mystical powers. A Siren. Specifically, one named Lilith. The official reports say she died in New Haven, but I'm positive she's hiding out near Sanctuary. If you catch wind of her, tell me and I'll pay you enough money to build a mansion made out of other, smaller mansions. Out.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_AsstheAss_03_echo_Jack.wav=Yeah, I just realized you grunts are gonna get yourselves killed without this little tidbit: all Sirens are born with different, crazy-ass powers. You cannot -- I repeat, CANNOT win a fight with them in one on one combat. you see Lilith, contact me IMMEDIATELY. I can handle her -- you can't. Me yes, you no!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_AsstheAss_04_echo_Jack.wav=Found an old recording that might help you guys out with the Siren. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_AsstheAss_04a_echo_Tannis.wav=I've been observing this Siren, Lilith, since the opening of the Vault. She appears to be using Eridium to enhance her natural Phasewalking abilities – this, naturally leads me to assume some unspoken connection between Sirens, Eridium, and the Vault. I have determined two additional things: firstly, that she finds it irritating when others pluck out strands of her hair under the guise of needing them for scientific experimentation, and secondly, that they taste like olives -- wait, no -- fried pickles.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_AsstheAss_05_echo_Jack.wav=Oh, yeah, and since you shiver-brains evidently don't know how to listen, I'll say it again: stop bringing in fake Sirens. Only six  Sirens can exist in the universe at any given time, and I already know of three -- you're not gonna convince me you happened to find one of the remaining three just by drawing blue tattoos on some random chick's corpse. I will admit, it was mildly amusing the first dozen times you idiots tried it, but now my office smells like blood and marker fumes. So quit it!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_AsstheAss_06_echo_Roland.wav=If you're hearing this message, it means you've killed the Hyperion spies. Your payment is attached -- the Crimson Raiders thank you, soldier.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_AsstheAss_06_live_Psycho.wav=I can still taste her lovely sweatbox! She fed me tears of ecstasy!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_AsstheAss_07_live_Psycho.wav=LIAR! I ripped out her bumpy tummy, and her hot screams were for ME!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_AsstheAss_08_live_Psycho.wav=Mommy bled for us both! She bled for us BOTH!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_01_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Do you see my hat? It is the hat of a gentleman. And yet, it’s missing something -- some je ne sais quois. I think some bullymong fur might do the trick, if you could bring me some. To harvest Bullymong fur, you’ll need to rrrip it from their hides with your bare hands -- just weaken a Bullymong with gunfire, then finish him off with fisticuffs!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_02_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=There -- you’ve weakened that Bullymong! Now give him a mighty blow with your melee weapon and take his fur!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_03_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Lovely -- he’s weak! Now finish him off with a melee strike!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_04_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=The Bullymong is injured -- now, deliver the coup de grace with your melee weapon!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_05_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=I apologize, I wasn’t clear enough -- you see, you’ll need to kill the Bullymong with a melee attack in order to harvest its fur. Sure, you could try to steal the fur from a bullymong’s dead body, but where’s the fun in that? Blatantly unreasonable requests, ho!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_06_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=A stunning riposte! Now, collect the fur -- in addition to making for spectacular hat decoration, I shall study the fur for my almanac about the creatures of Pandora.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_07_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=That sample will do admirably! Find me a few more, if you please.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_08_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Spectacular fisticuffsmanship!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_09_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Ooh -- are you collecting Bullymong fur? I LOVE that stuff! It’s soft, warm, and really good at absorbing robot tears! Once you’re done collecting all the fur, why doncha bring it to me instead of Hammerlock?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_10_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Ooh -- a crushing blow!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_11_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=I overheard Claptrap asking you for the Bullymong fur you’re collecting. As I fear he would do something irredeemably stupid with it, like make a mohawk out of it or something, let me sweeten the deal: if you bring me the fur, I shall give you one of my finest sniper rifles.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_12_echoX_Claptrap.wav=You thwacked that bullymong like a champ, minion!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_13_echoX_Claptrap.wav=So Hammerlock wants to give you a sniper rifle? I laugh at his offer! HA! If you bring ME the fur, I’ll give you a badass shotgun I found in the hands of a dead vault hunter! It’s really fresh -- you can still smell the sadness on it!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_14_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Epic smackdown! Nice hit, minion -- now grab the last piece of fur and bring it to me!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_15_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Wonderful -- you’ve gotten all the fur I need. Bring it to me, and my sniper rifle shall be yours.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_16_echoX_Claptrap.wav=Screw that noise -- bring ME the fur, and I’ll give you a shotgun!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_17_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=A trillion thanks, Vault Hunter! You’ve helped a foolish old man look far more badass than he deserves. (beat.) I’m referring to myself, of course. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_18_echoX_Claptrap.wav=I'm very disappointed in you, minion! (beat.) Now I'm over it. We're best friends again!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_19_echoX_Claptrap.wav=FUR MOHAWK, BABY! WOOO! You made the right decision, minion. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BadHairDay_20_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=You gave the fur to Claptrap? Suppose I can't blame you -- the lure of a shotgun is not easily resisted. No hard feelings, chum!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BearBadNews_01_echoX_Mordecai.wav=The folks in Sanctuary don't know about Roland. Almost none of them would still be alive if it weren't for him, so...you might wanna let 'em know.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BearBadNews_02_echoX_Moxxi.wav=Jack killed Roland? Son of a bitch…he helped me take care of Mister Shank, and, unlike…well, damn near everyone around here, he always behaved like a gentlemen. I don't…I don't know what to say. Dammit, am I crying?

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BearBadNews_04_echoX_Marcus.wav=Roland's…dead? …Oh. Me and him didn't see eye to eye most of the time -- he never liked how I sold guns to the bandits -- but I would have died in New Haven if it weren't for him. He was a…he was a good man.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BearBadNews_07_echoX_Scooter.wav=Tell you what -- I'll give you a discount at my catch-a-rides if you promise me you'll ram one a' my cars straight up Jack's tailpipe, alright?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BearBadNews_08_echoX_Tannis.wav=Had Roland not forced me to relocate to Sanctuary, I would not be alive today. I am unpleasantly surprised to find that I am...sorry, that Roland is dead.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BearBadNews_08a_EchoX_PatriciaTannis.wav=(broken up) While the logistics of the situation pointed towards at least one death between the likes of Roland, Lilith, or Mordecai, I wanted it to be the drunk.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BearBadNews_15_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Sorry to bum you out like that, but somebody needed to tell ‘em. I've transmitted the code to Roland's armory to your ECHO device --  if anyone deserves what's in there, it oughtta be the badass who’s gonna avenge him.

And we kill Jack, his associates, his friends, his FAMILY -- everyone's he's EVER MET! WE SKIN 'EM WITH THEIR OWN GODDAMN TEETH! (heavy breathing) I'm sorry.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_12_echoX_Sam.wav=Look, between you and me? OCantler's the thief. When we were making out, he was all, "yeah, baby, I'm gonna steal all that money," and I was like "no, don't do that," and he's like "oh yeah baby, I'm gonna" and I was like "that's so wrong."
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_13_echoX_Jim.wav=Look, given what we know about human consciousness, I can be certain of only one thing: I didn't steal the money. I know my own mind, and I know my mind didn't steal it. If I knew everyone else's minds I might be able to help you a bit more, but, sadly, I can only speak for myself. And I'm doing that now. Speaking, to say that I didn't steal the money.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_14_echoX_OCantler.wav=Sam's full of crap.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_14a_sam_Sam.wav=Ow! It wasn't ME!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_14b_echoX_Lindy.wav=What the hell! 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_14c_echoX_OCantler.wav=Ouch, mate.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_15_echoX_Jim.wav=They weren't the thief! They didn't have any money on them! SCREW IT!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_16_echoX_Lindy.wav=Hunh -- guess Jim did steal the cash.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_17_echoX_Sam.wav=But we were friends! That's sad. But maybe we...maybe we learned something?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_18_echoX_OCantler.wav=Yeah. We learned that Jim stole the cash.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BFFs_19_echoX_SAM.wav=Hey, thanks for saving seventy-five percent of us. Take this.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BloodCrystal_01_live_SirHammerlock.wav=Lovely creatures, crystalisks. I'm curious to see how they fight. I've heard a few live in the Fridge -- I'd give them the old one-two if my leg weren't acting up, but you'll do me the favor of hunting a few, won't you?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BloodCrystal_02_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=Now, you'll want to knock their crystals off with a melee thwack before shooting at them. Try not to die while doing so. If possible.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BloodCrystal_03_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=No no no -- knock the crystals off with your melee weapon, then shoot the body. Good lad.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BloodCrystal_04_echo_SirHammerlock.wav="Hammerlock," you're asking, "how can you call the crystalisks lovely, then ask me to kill them?" Simple -- the beauty of a creature can only be truly seen in its survival instincts. When a creature is nearest to death, you see how alive it can be. If you think that  a slightly psychopathic worldview, no worries -- you wouldn't be the first!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BloodCrystal_05_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=Wonderful! You've seen the crystalisks at their finest. Return to me!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BloodCrystal_06_live_SirHammerlock.wav=Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyArmLeg_01_echoX_Mal.wav=I know why I still don't feel human! I don't have limbs! I hear those bandits have tons of limbs to spare -- you could ask them for a few!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyArmLeg_02_echoX_TunnelRat.wav=OUR FOOODSSSSSS! GIVE THEM BACKSSSSS!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyArmLeg_03_echo_Mal.wav=Those sure are some quality limbs! Could you get a few more? I'd like to have a wide variety to choose from! We humans love choices!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyArmLeg_04_echo_Mal.wav=So many limbs -- I can't wait to try them out! Come on back!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyArmLeg_05_live_Mal.wav=Yes, these limbs are clearly the best. Humanity, here I come!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyArmLeg_06_live_Mal.wav=Hi! I'm human! I eat food, and desire things! I'm in credit card debt and have a wife for whom I feel nothing!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyArmLeg_07_live_Mal.wav=Aw. Still doesn't feel right...
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyClothes_01_echoX_Mal.wav=Hi! I don't want to kill you! Which is kind of weird! I need your help! Oh -- I should have a name, -- humans have names! I bet I'm malfunctioning like the dickens, so...how about Mal?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyClothes_02_echoX_Mal.wav=Hi! I'm a robot! And I don't like that!  Could you help me become human? Maybe? I don't wear clothes, but I see humans wearing lots of clothes -- could you get me clothes from those bandit guys nearby? I'll wear so many clothes -- I'll be the best human ever!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyClothes_02a_echoX_Mal.wav=Ooh -- that piece of armor will make a great hat, or shirt, or pair of pants for me! Even though it's just a little piece of armor, I will treat it like pants! If this seems illogical, good! Humans are often illogical!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyClothes_03_echoX_Mal.wav=Great! You got clothes! Thanks for getting all those clothes! Bring the clothes back to me, Mal, and I'll wear the clothes!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyClothes_03a_echoX_Mal.wav=Ooh. Swanky!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyClothes_03b_echoX_Mal.wav=That looks great!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyClothes_03c_echoX_Mal.wav=Yay, clothes!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyClothes_04_echoX_Mal.wav=Thanks! I am now wearing the clothes. I think I look great. Ooh -- vanity! That's very human! So...why don't I feel human yet? Hmmm.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyHuman_01_echoX_Mal.wav=Hi!  I've come to a realization! I now see that humanity doesn't come from wearing clothes, or having a face made of flesh -- on Pandora, humanity means trying to kill other humans! Sooooo...die!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyHuman_02_echoX_Mal.wav=Thank you for helping me! Once I've murdered you, I will truly be a human being!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyHuman_02a_echoX_Mal.wav=You're fighting back -- a very human instinct!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyHuman_02b_echoX_Mal.wav=I think I am doing very well in this fight!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyHuman_02c_echoX_Mal.wav=I am trying very hard to win!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyHuman_02d_echoX_Mal.wav=If I were alive, my adrenaline would be pumping!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyHuman_02e_echoX_Mal.wav=I can't wait to eat food!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyHuman_03_echoX_Mal.wav=Ow! That hurt! Wait! Humans feel pain! I felt pain! That must mean I'm human!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyHuman_04_echoX_Mal.wav=(singing) I'm hu-man! I'm hu-man! Yay! This is the best day of my life!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BoyHuman_05_echoX_Mal.wav=By the way, that fight was very fun! Please feel free to come back so we may do it again!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_01_echoX_brick.wav=There are three things I wanna do: 1. Fight TheSheriff. 2. Blow stuff up. 3. Get paid. So, blowin' apart TheSheriff's bank is basically the dream job. Head to the bank and case the joint.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_02_echo_Brick.wav=Looks like the wall's made of poly-kryten, which only dissolves when exposed to skag bile. I got an idea --we need a bomb, covered in skag bile. Now, this ain't gonna make a lot of sense, but just bear with me: first, find some laxative. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_03_echo_Brick.wav=Now that you've got the laxative, it's time to find some explosives. (beat.) That may be my favorite sentence I've ever said. Anyway, there should be a bandit  around there named Mad Dog -- sumbitch loved to toss dynamite at my slabs when they came into town. Take him out and get his boomers.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_04_live_MadDog.wav=Rootin'tootin'lootin' son of a gun!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_05_echo_Brick.wav=We got what we need to make a bile bomb. Go slap the bomb down outside a skag den. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_06_echo_TheSheriff.wav=Explosives, huh? That oughtta be fun. I'd stop you, but the punishment for unlawful use of Hyperion explosives is much cooler than the punishment for intent to use them.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_07_echo_Brick.wav=Cool. Now coat it in laxative. The skag will eat the bomb,  cover it in his bile, then vomit it back up. Then we can blast through the bank door! Simple, except for how goddamn complicated it is!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_08_echo_Brick.wav=He went for it! Lucky for us, skags eat and crapoutta the same hole, so this won't take too long. Follow him and get the bomb back when he horks it back up.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_09_echo_Brick.wav=He blarted the bomb -- go get it!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_10_echo_Brick.wav=Voila! One skagbile bomb ready for bank-bustin'! Just slap that on the bank wall and wait for the fireworks!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_11_echo_Brick.wav=Get back!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_12_echo_TheSheriff.wav=Ooh, a bank robbery -- now you're talkin'. Get ?em, boys.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_13_echo_Brick.wav=Ah, crap. Bank guards. Get rid of ?em!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_14_echo_Brick.wav=Well done! Now loot the place!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_14a_echo_Brick.wav=You got the money? Now get outta town, slab, before The Sheriff sics her posse on ya!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_14b_echoX_Bandit.wav=That slab busted the bank! Let's loot the place and kill that idiot! 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_15_echo_Brick.wav=Now, this wouldn't be a proper bank robbery without a cool getaway -- get runnin'!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_16_echo_TheSheriff.wav=Nice robbery. I think you deserve my best -- posse! Get after ?em!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_17_echo_TheSheriff.wav=Brick always did have a flare for the dramatic. Made a real scene of it when he escaped my jail -- blew the it sky high, swore revenge for what Jack and I did to him, said we'd turned him into a bandit the moment we killed his dog. Dealin' with you, I think, is gonna be much simpler for both of us. I die, or you do. Nice and clean.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_18_echo_Brick.wav=Keep the cash -- knowin' TheSheriff is pissed is payment enough for me. Lemme know when you're ready for the next job.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_19_echo_Brick.wav=Blowin' stuff up, gettin' paid. Living the dream.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_20_echo_Brick.wav=You're near the vault -- see if you can open it.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_21_echo_Brick.wav=Damn -- I knew it wouldn't be that easy. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_BreakingtheBank_22_echo_Brick.wav=Now, you gotta stash that cash or the Sheriff's boys won't ever stop lookin' for ya. Find a good place to hide it and my boys'll pick it up later. Don't worry -- I'll pay ya even more than what you got from the bank job once this is all over.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ChosenOne_01_echoX_Marcus.wav=I was making change for some idiot named Kai few weeks back, and gave him a ten instead of a one. I need you to track him down and get the nine bucks he owes me. He was mumbling into an ECHO device when he came in -- maybe you can track him by finding his transmissions.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ChosenOne_02_echo_Kai.wav=Welcome, welcome, faithful listeners, to Kai'sKorner, episode ninety-eight. Pandora is crap. Nobody's heard of me here. Uh, hello? Five billion ECHOcast subscribers. Maybe get outta the stone age, douchebags --

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ChosenOne_08_echo_Kai.wav=I'm an ECHOcast host, not a hero. You can't be saying--
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ChosenOne_09_echo_Marcus.wav=The prophecies spoke of a man who would come to Sanctuary, forever speaking into an ECHO recorder. He would be a humble man, of unknown origins --
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ChosenOne_10_echo_Kai.wav= --Uh, I've got five billion subscribers?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ChosenOne_11_echo_Marcus.wav=(backpedalling) A very famous man, beloved the galaxy over! He would wield the... Evil...Smasher forged by my own hand, and save our galaxy forever!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ChosenOne_14_echo_Kai.wav= --How much for the Evil Smasher?!!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ChosenOne_15_echo_Marcus.wav=(suddenly pragmatic and disinterested) Two million dollars.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ChosenOne_16_echo_Kai.wav=Faithful listeners...I am going to save the galaxy. Armed with the Evil Smasher, given to me by the wise seer Marcus, I will head into the heart of Sawtooth Cauldron and cleanse it of evil.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_CircleOfSlaughter_02_echo_Moxxi.wav=Ah, the Natural Selection Annex -- as deadly as it is pungent. Talk to Captain Cabrera  when you're ready to step into the ring.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_CircleOfSlaughter_03_echo_Moxxi.wav=Made it to the robot slaughter, didya? Talk to InnuendoBot to get started -- he's an old Hyperion loader I reprogrammed a while back. Pretty proud of how he turned out, if I do say so myself.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_CircleOfSlaughter_04_echo_Moxxi.wav=Those bandits didn't stand a virgin's chance in the red light district! Go see Fink for your reward.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_CircleOfSlaughter_05_echo_Moxxi.wav=Well done, sugar! Since you survived, Captain Cabrera owes me some serious….payment. By which I mean "money." Sorry, it's hard to turn that sexy voice off.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DefendTower_01_echoX_Brick.wav=Shaddap, Rocko. Alright, slab -- a Hyperion supply just landed in our turf instead of Jack's. Jack wants to destroy the supplies so we can't use 'em. You've gotta stop him. Take Rocko's flags.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DefendTower_02_echoX_Brick.wav=I marked some key defense points. Drop a flag on any of 'em, and my Slabs'll know where they gotta go and what kinda firepower they gotta bring.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_01_echoX_Brick.wav=Every day, TheSheriff of Lynchwood sends whatever Eridium she's yanked from the mines back to Jack. That stops today -- you're gonna blow up the train she uses to transport the stuff. Get to the demolition depository.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_02_echo_Brick.wav=You can get a bomb cart from that depository. Shut the door at the end of the track before the bomb reaches it.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_05_echo_Brick.wav=Damn, you're strong! Take it to the abandoned train tracks. You're gonna put it on a collison course with TheSheriff's eridium train.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_05a_echo_Sheriff.wav=Lemme tell you a  something about Brick. We snagged him during the fall of New Haven. He never sold out his friends, but his puppy -- it was this little brown thing -- once I wrapped my hands around its neck, Brick lost it. You could barely hear the crack of the bone over his sobs. I mean, actual sobbing -- like a baby. It was pretty embarrassing.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_05b_echo_Sheriff.wav=I hear that after Brick  escaped our custody, he tracked down the guy who betrayed New Haven to  Hyperion. Somebody named Shep Sanders. Brick gouged his eyes out with his thumbs and cracked his skull open like an egg, all while poor Shep screamed for mercy. Your friend Roland kicked him outta Sanctuary after that. You vault hunters think you're different from bandits. But you're not.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_06_echo_Brick.wav=I had one of my slabs set up a detonator for the bomb cart -- get to the detonator before TheSheriff's train leaves and we lose our shot!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_07_echo_Brick.wav=Don't hit the detonator until it's right on top of TheSheriff's train!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_08_echo_Brick.wav=Didn't make it in time! We lost our shot!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_09_echo_Brick.wav=You borked the explosion? Damn! We missed our shot!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_10_echo_Brick.wav=Hell yeah! No more Eridium's comin' outta Lynchwood now, that's for sure! Lemme know when you're ready for the next thing.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_11_echo_TheSheriff.wav=Gotta say -- that's pretty irritating. The Eridium mine's half the reason this town exists. Well, credit where credit's due -- you really know how to push my buttons.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DestroyTrain_12_echo_Brick.wav=Man, you see the way that train went up? Ahhh. I am a man who loves explosions.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DocOrders_01_live_Tannis.wav=Some people, who are not me, might consider Slag experimentation immoral. Some people would not be willing to pay you a great deal of money for bringing me experiment results from The Hyperion Preserve. Some people are stupid.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DocOrders_03_echo_DoctorSamuels.wav=It's "Doctor Samuels". The test subject is still conscious. You can't expect me to --
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_DocOrders_04_echo_Jack.wav=Sorry, baby, I can't hear you over the sound of people not being injected with Eridium. This Vault key didn't make Eridium come outta the ground for nothing -- we've got it, so we might as well experiment with it. You're not eager to be on the other side of that glass, are you?

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Enkinding_18_live_Lilith.wav=Friggin' cults.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_EternalFlame_01_live_Lilith.wav=So, I...kind of inspired a cult. And not the fun, ask-you-for-autographs kind. I need you to infiltrate the Children of the Firehawk, and find out if they're planning anything shady. I'd do it myself but I'm kinda worried they'd freak out if they saw their god in person. Go talk to the cult's leader, Incinerator Clayton.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_EternalFlame_02_live_IncineratorClayton.wav=I am Incinerator Clayton. And you.... I witnessed you enter the lair of the Firehawk, and return unharmed. If you truly wish to serve our mother, you must pass a test; use a fire weapon to send my brothers to the Eternal Flame. Then collect their ashes and return them to me.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_EternalFlame_03_echoX_Lilith.wav=Hunh. Burning people alive is mildly shady, but these cultist sound like they want it. Which is weird. Do what he asks, I guess.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_EternalFlame_03a_echoX_Lilith.wav=These guys are resistant to fire, but Clayton wants you to burn them to death -- could be tricky. You might wanna whittle them down with a non-elemental gun, then switch to a fire weapon to finish them off.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_EternalFlame_03b_echoX_Lilith.wav=You've gotta burn the incinerators to death to get their ashes -- make sure you've got a fire weapon.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_EternalFlame_03c_echoX_Lilith.wav=Remember -- since those guys resist fire, you should beat the tar out of them with a non-fire weapon, then switch to a fire weapon for the last few shots.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FalseIdols_01_live_IncineratorClayton.wav=Unfortunate news, torch. There are idolators amongst us -- children who have betrayed their one true mother, the Firehawk. They follow a heathen demigod known as Scorch -- I implore you, destroy this pretender and all those who follow him.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FalseIdols_02_echo_Lilith.wav=Who cares if they worship somebody else? Look -- just play along. Clayton needs to trust you completely -- if they've been doing anything that we need to stop, that's the only way you'll hear about it.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FalseIdols_06_echoX_Lilith.wav=As weird as this cult is...I gotta admit, seeing them kill that false god for me was kind of flattering. Ehh -- I'm a bad person.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FalseIdols_07_echoX_Lilith.wav=These people are weird, but they only seem to hurt themselves and that Scorch guy. Maybe we should just leave ?em alone.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FalseIdols_08_echoX_IncineratorClayton.wav=You made the idolators pay. For this, I thank you.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_03_echo_Mordecai.wav=The creatures oughtta help you tear up the engineers. Make it bloody.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_04_echo_Mordecai.wav=That’s right, pendejos. Let ‘em rip you apart.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_05_echo_Mordecai.wav=That’s for Bloodwing, assholes!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_06_echo_Mordecai.wav=Good job killing those bastards. That’s enough. For now. Come on back.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_07_echoX_Mordecai.wav=That’s just the beginning. Every Hyperion bastard’s gonna pay for Bloodwing. Every one of ‘em.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_08_live_DoucheEngineer.wav= I used to torture cats for fun back on Tantalus, but now I get PAID to do it. God, I love my job.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_09_live_DoucheEngineer2.wav=Living the dream, my man. Living the dream.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_10_live_DoucheEngineer.wav=Hey, you hear about that big bird thing? The Bloodwing?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_11_live_DoucheEngineer2.wav=Oh, man. I've got the security footage of that thing exploding on my ECHO unit so I can watch it whenever I'm bored.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_12_live_DoucheEngineer.wav=And that friggin' Vault Hunter who gets splattered with blood -- the look on that douchebag's face!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_13_live_DoucheEngineer2.wav=Ha! Classic. Absolutely classic.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_14_live_DoucheEngineer.wav=Alright, alright, that's enough. Better cut the chatter and make sure this damn stalker gets tortured RIGHT.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_FreeWilly_15_live_DoucheEngineer2.wav=Yeah, alright. (beat.) Love my job.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_01_echoX_Mordecai.wav=Few years back, I won two prizes in Moxxi's Underdome -- a chest full a' loot, and Moxxi herself. I lost the second prize to Jack, and the first to a thief named Carson. I don't care if I never see those guns again, but if you want 'em, just find Carson in The Dust.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_02_echo_Gettle.wav=Where's the chest, Carson?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_03_echo_Carson.wav=What was that noise? It sounded like some Hyperion screw trying to pump me for info. Didn't it sound like that, brother?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_04_echo_Mavis.wav=It sure did, brother. Why don't --
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_05_echo_Carson.wav=Mavis! NO!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_06_echo_Mordecai.wav=Gettle's after the treasure, too? Crap -- he's a Hyperion goon, more bent than a boomerang. He probably took Carson to the Hyperion Friendship Gulag.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_07_echo_Carson.wav=You'll break us outta here if I tell you?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_08_echo_Mobley.wav=Course! I'm your pal, Carson! Now, where's that chest?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_09_echo_CARSON.wav=The flats. Buried under a grave. So, when do we bust outta here?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_10_echo_Mobley.wav=Hah! Idiot.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_11_echo_Carson.wav=Urk!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_12_echo_Mobley.wav=...Pal.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_13_echo_Mordecai.wav=Carson's dead? No surprises there. I've heard of that Mobley guy. Small-time bandit. Dangerous. Watch yourself.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_14_echoX_Mobley.wav=Finally! I been waiting in that church for hours for someone to dig it up in case it was booby-trapped! Now hand it over.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_14_echoX_Mobley.wav=Thanks for diggin' it up, pal! I couldn't find the right grave, seein' how I can't read.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_15_echoX_Gettle.wav=Get away from the stash, bandits!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_15a_echoX_Mobley.wav=Dammit, vault hunter -- you led that Hyperion jackass here?!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_15b_echoX_Gettle.wav=You bandits put down your guns and move back from the stash, NOW!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_15c_echoX_Mobley.wav=Better idea, jackass -- we all draw when the church bell rings for the third time! 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GoodBadMord_15d_echoX_Gettle.wav=A truxican standoff? Fine.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GrandmasHouse_01_echo_Jack.wav=I need your help. I know -- "argh, trap, don't listen" -- but it's about my grandma. I built her a cottage out in the Eridium Blight, and I need you to check on her, make sure everything's as it should be. Don't do it for me; do it for her.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GrandmasHouse_02_echo_Jack.wav=(initially sounding inconsolab,e then incredibly relieved) Ohhhhhhh, thank GOD! I was so worried you'd killed those bandits before they could murder ol' gran-gran. And you know what now I don't even have to pay 'em!  So, thanks, loser.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GrandmasHouse_03_echo_Jack.wav=Woah woah woah woah – are there bandits at grandma's house? Oh, Jesus. Oh crap.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GrandmasHouse_04_echo_Jack.wav=You killed the bandits? Okay. Okay. God, I hope everything's okay.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_GrandmasHouse_05_echo_Jack.wav=Thanks for the help, man. Still gonna kill you, though.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HanginOut_01_echoX_Brick.wav=Jack just appointed a new sheriff in Lynchwood -- the same skaglick who Jack had torture me way back. The Sheriff thinks bein' a lawman is just about killin' everyone who disagrees with you.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_01_echoX_Moxxi.wav=Jack destroyed my underdome when he thought I was cheating on him, and now he wants to build his own arena just to rub it in my face. We're not gonna let that happen, sugar. Get out to Opportunity and kill the construction foreman who's running the project.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_02_echo_Moxxi.wav=Ooh -- he dropped a  key. Do a lady a favor and grab it.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_02a_echo_Moxxi.wav=Every key fits in a lock, sugar -- check the containers, see if that key opens one of 'em.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_02b_echo_Jack.wav=Ol' balloon-tits is still holdin' a grudge against me, huh? Don't get me wrong, I understand it -- once you've eaten prime rib for free, it's hard to go back to suckin' down hamburgers for cash. If you know what I'm talking about.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_02c_echo_Jack.wav=I'm talkin' about dicks.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_02d_echo_Moxxi.wav=Sounds like that key was just the right size. See if there's anything useful in there.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_03_echo_Moxxi.wav=If I know my explosives -- and I'd like to think I do -- you could use those charges to flood the construction site. If you'd blow up the nearby retaining wall and flood those pits, I'd be awful grateful.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_03a__Jack.wav=My construction site! Moxxi, you BITCH!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_04_echo_Moxxi.wav=Ha! Haven't heard Jack that angry since I kicked his plastic surgeried-ass to the curb. Come on back, sugar.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_05_echo_Moxxi.wav=Nothin' like a little vengeance to round out the day.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_06_echo_Moxxi.wav=Get away from the explosives, sugar -- they're gonna make a big boom.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HellHath_1a_echo_Moxxi.wav=There's the foreman -- drop him for me, will ya?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals_01_echoX_Tannis.wav=In a fit of extreme paranoia, I hid my notes on the opening of the Vault, and promptly forgot their locations. While I grind my teeth to dust in frustration, you will retrieve these journals for me.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals_02_echoX_Tannis.wav=I am going to die. Roland forcibly relocated me to Sanctuary for what he claimed was my safety, but the slackjaws who populate this city make my flesh scream. A young woman said "hello" to me today. I stared back at her, my mind screeching as I looked for a way to escape this unwanted interaction. As my face grew red with nauseous stress, a blood vessel popped in my nose, and a jet of crimson shot out of my nostrils, splattering us both with blood. She, screamed and ran away. As pleased as I was at the time, I fear causing fountains of blood to shoot from my face will not be a viable long-term strategy for avoiding conversation.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals_03_echoX_Tannis.wav=The same questions occurred to me today, as I was pinning a disemboweled skag to my front door to dissuade others from approaching it. What does Jack want with the Vault Key? Was the key simply charging the entire time I possessed it, before Jack crowbarred it from my bloody hands? Was it waiting to unleash its alien powers on Pandora, to make Eridium appear from the very ground? Was it preparing itself to unlock even more alien ruins? I will delve deeper into this question after I soundproof the walls of my home, that I may be spared the incessant laughter and joviality of Sanctuary's citizens.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals_04_EchoX_Tannis.wav=I have uncovered legends of an ancient alien warrior. The legends tell of a magical key that can bring it back to life. If my hypotheses are correct -- which they always are -- the legends may be speaking of the Vault Key. Also, a young man told me I was pretty on my way back from the grocer's. My reaction was surprisingly tame -- I only spent the next three hours dry-heaving into a bucket.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals_05_echo_Tannis.wav=Yesterday, I had a conversation with another human being. Granted, it was a conversation only inasmuch as my grunts of social terror could be taken as human speech, but Roland did not seem to mind. He asked me why Jack hasn't revived the warrior yet, if he has the key. I conveyed that the key needed to be charged by Eridium -- hence Jack's mining operations. He nodded, and silently wiped the streams of my saliva from his face. I returned home, confused not only at his lack of disgust toward my behavior, but my lack of disgust toward him. For the first time, I felt as if I could actually live in Sanctuary. For the first time, I feel as if...I might be okay.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals_06_echoX_Tannis.wav=You listened to my notes, I assume? I would be upset, were it not for the equally privacy-indifferent background check I ran on you before hiring you for this job.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals2_01_echo_PatriciaTannis.wav=I hid my copious material I compiled after opening the Vault those five long years ago. In a fit of spastic paranoia, I did not write down the locations to the information. Find it for me and be handsomely. (Long pause.) Oh, were you expecting me to say "handsomely rewarded?"
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals2_02_echo_PatriciaTannis.wav=I've been relocated to Santuary against everyone's better judgement -- not my own mind you, I never wanted to be here. I was perfectly content to live out my days in a non-standard living arrangement with two ceiling chairs I met at a bar fight. Oh, they're adorable -- they barely speak any English -- and if you have to ask what a ceiling chair is, I pity the life you've wasted.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals2_03_echo_PatriciaTannis.wav=I should discuss the Scrollophant in the room. The reason for my relocation was an elongated and systematically unpleasant torture at the hands of Jack's cronies. Roland, and his well-defined pectorial muscles, were kind enough to entrust the Vault Key with me after the awakening of the Destroyer, not to be confused with the Warrior, seriously, those sound nothing alike. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals2_04_echo_PatriciaTannis.wav=Oh, right, torture! I asked nicely on several occasions to take proper precautions against bacteria on the instruments, but it fell upon idiotic ears. As they cut into my flesh over and over, I would fade in and out of conciousness and whisper to the ceiling chairs that it was going to be okay. Clork was afraid at first, his four legs trembled against the cold ceiling, but he knew he had to be strong for me. Then they went to work on his brother, Phillipe.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals2_05_echo_PatriciaTannis.wav=(actually crying) Phillipe -- I, I just -- Phillipe was so brave. He was so brave for me when the rotary saws began to ply his legs from his body. Clork cried out for his brother, even when one of the torturers inadvertantly sat on him and muffled his cries. The last thing Phillipe said before he passed on to the great wooden beyond was, "I love you, Patty, I love you." And then he was gone.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals2_06_echo_PatriciaTannis.wav=It's lonely here in Sanctuary, sure Clork prattles around on the ceiling, but it's hardly the same. Jack has taken so much from me -- Jack has taken the only happiness I've ever had in his acinine quest for the Warrior and more power. Revenge is as pointless as music, but on this occasion, I will allow myself the revenge, I will allow myself to aid in his downfall. Mark my words, Jack, you're going to die.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HiddenJournals2_07_echo_PatriciaTannis.wav=Ah -- the chronicles of my torture. I shall warm up some cocoa and listen to these again.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_01_echoX_Lilith.wav=Jack's broadcasting a 24-hour stream of propaganda, to every family in the six galaxies, telling them to immigrate to that big-ass city he's building. You're gonna show them what a bad idea that really is. Go borrow Moxxi's camcorder.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_02_live_Moxxi.wav=You want my camera, hunh? You can borrow it on one condition -- anything you shoot better involve naked flesh, or explosions. Bonus points for both.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_03_echo_Lilith.wav=Great -- take that camera to Opportunity. And, uh, make sure you don't look at Moxxi's footage.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_04_live_HyperionFemale.wav=Feast your eyes upon the paradise that awaits you in Opportunity! A world filled with excitement and potential! Just think -- right now THIS could be you!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_05_live_HyperionFemale.wav=Or THIS!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_06_live_HyperionFemale.wav=Or THIS!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_07_live_HyperionFemale.wav=Emigrate to Opportunity today!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_08_echo_Lilith.wav=Camera's on? Good.  I need you to snag an orbital drop beacon and some surveyor lures. I'll explain why once you've got 'em. Oh, and while you're at it, take out some engineers -- we need to show the universe  this town is  as good for your health as a bullet to the face.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_09_echo_Lilith.wav=That oughtta do it. Get to the co-opportunity outreach center and broadcast that footage you shot.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_09a_echo_Lilith.wav=Now, to broadcast the fruits of your hard work.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_10_live_Moxxi.wav=Oh Mordecai, just put the bird away -- or, actually...don't.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_11_live_HyperionFemale.wav=Feast your eyes upon the paradise that awaits you in Opportunity! A world filled with excitement and potential! This life can be yours! Just think -- right now THIS could be you!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_13_live_HyperionFemale.wav=Or THIS!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_14_live_HyperionFemale.wav=Emigrate to Opportunity today!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_15_echo_Lilith.wav=Your work's done. Doubt anyone'll be in a hurry to move here, now. Uh...bird lovers notwithstanding. Come on back.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_16_echo_Lilith.wav=With those lures, you can trick those surveyor bots to fly wherever you want. If you slap the lures on some Jack propaganda, the surveyors should crash into 'em. Could be fun.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HomeMovies_17_echo_Lilith.wav=Take that orbital supply beacon to the big crane past the waterfront quarter. Once you call in a drop, the moonshot will destroy the crane -- should look great on film.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryLikeSkag_01_echo_CarloTheBandit.wav=What a nice day. Just walkin' out in the sun, talkin' into my ECHO recorder, hoping skags don't ambush me, and break my gun into four separate parts before eating them. (we hear skags attack Carlo, viciously ripping him apart. we hear his gun break apart.) OH GOD! THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING! AHHHHH!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryLikeSkag_02_echo_Marcus.wav=Oof -- skags ate a gun? No way to tell which one of the ugly things has it -- just start hunting skags and hope for the best!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryLikeSkag_03_echo_Marcus.wav=Hey, you found all the gun parts! Bring them back here and I'll assemble them for you.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryLikeSkag_04_echo_Marcus.wav=No charge. This time.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryScagP1_01_echo_Scooter.wav=Aw, that little feller looks wounded -- his mom musta abandoned him or somesuch. I'd usually recommend bussin' a cap in his cooch-mouth, but he seems nice enough -- you could get him some medicine so he stops makin' that sad-ass noise, though.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryScagP2_01_echo_Scooter.wav=Awww. He looks hungry. Maybe get ?im some skag chews.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryScagP2_02_echo_Scooter.wav=Aw -- that skag looks sad sas hell, all chained up like 'at. Maybe you could blast that chain and let him loose. Uh, 'pologies in advance if he eats yer face off.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryScagP2_03_echo_Scooter.wav=You found a new cave for that hungry skag, huh? He looks pretty happy. Well, as happy as a mindless killin' machine with vertical jaws and a powerful hunger for flesh can be, anyway.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryScagP3_01_echo_Scooter.wav=He still looks hungry, huh? Maybe some skagtongues'll fill ?im up -- just shoot enough skags in the mouth and you'll have a friggin' smorgasbord ready for him.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryScagP3_02_echo_Scooter.wav=You think it's weird that we're feedin' a skag parts of other skags? That feels kinda weird.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HungryScagP4_01_echo_Scooter.wav=Ol’ rover here looks waaaay too big to sleep in that lil’ shoebox anymore. You might wanna escort him to some new digs.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HypContract873_01_echo_HyperionFemale.wav=The Hyperion corporation wishes to extend an olive branch, murderer. Should you considerably lower this world's bandit population, Hyperion is willing to reward you with a unique gun crafted just for you.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_HypContract873_03_echo_HyperionFemale.wav=Enjoy the Hyperion XKCD experimental weapon. Custom designed...for a murderer like yourself.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_01_echoX_Claptrap.wav=The Crimson Raiders need our help! Roland’s been having trouble with some Bloodshots in Three Horns. He just wants them dead, but I’ve got a MUCH better plan -- we’ll freeze ‘em out! Get out to the bandit camp and destroy their furnaces. Without heat, they’ll be too cold to fight anybody! Here -- take this blast-a-mite and put it on their furnaces.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_02_echo_Claptrap.wav=Great, you placed the dynamite! Now move onto the next furnace!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_03_echo_Claptrap.wav=Viva la resistance! Once you’ve destroyed all the furnaces, those bandits will be WAY too cold to fight -- they’ll CHILL OUT! Hahahahahah! CHILL OUT! You get it? Eh, went right over your head, didn’t it? 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_03a_echo_Claptrap.wav=See, it's funny because "chill" is a saying that means "calm down," but also means "cold." It's a single word with multiple meanings. That is mathematically HILARIOUS!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_03b_echo_Claptrap.wav=Since I still don't hear you laughing about "chill out", you must not understand humor in general.  See, humor is based on subverting expectations, often through play-on words. According to this formula of humor, my "chill out" comment was literally the funniest thing ever said by anyone.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_04_echo_Claptrap.wav=Okay -- you've got dynamite on all the furnaces, which means it's time to set it all off! Go use the remote detonator I had one of the Crimson Raiders set up out there. When he asked me why, I just told him: BE COOL. (beat.) HOW ARE YOU NOT LAUGHING RIGHT NOW?! That was F*CKING GOLD!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_04a_echo_Claptrap.wav=Just hit that detonator to destroy the furnaces and freeze those bandits into peacefulness!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_04b_echo_Claptrap.wav=Hey, bandits -- FREEZE! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_04c_echo_Claptrap.wav=Good job -- with their furnaces gone, the bandits will be WAY too cold to kill anybody!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_06_echo_Claptrap.wav=Ah, crap.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_07_echo_Claptrap.wav=Watch out, minion -- they’re wearing snow hats! Smack ‘em down, quick!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_08_echo_Claptrap.wav=So, instead of dropping all their weapons and running to hide from the cold, the bandits put on winter hats. Heck, I still call that a win! Come on back.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_IcemanCometh_09_echoX_Claptrap.wav=I still can’t believe you didn’t get my “chill out” joke.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_01_echoX_Lilith.wav=Ever faked your own death? Tricky stuff. Did it a couple years back to throw Hyperion off my trail, but apparently some bandit's been spying on me. He's gonna tell Hyperion what he knows, unless you take him out first.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_02_echoX_Lilith.wav=Did he just drop something? Check it out.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_03_echo_MisterBlake.wav=Mister Boll, we at Hyperion are skeptical - the bandit Lilith was confirmed dead after the liberation of New Haven. We will need to listen to your footage before payment can be processed; leave the ECHOs in the attached dead drop locations.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_04_echo_Lilith.wav=Find those ECHOs, killer; if Hyperion finds out I'm alive and working with the Crimson Raiders, it could be New Haven all over again.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_05_echo_Roland.wav=I like this place. Hyperion shouldn't be able to find you here.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_06_echo_Lilith.wav=Thanks. I tried to make it very...
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_07_echo_Roland.wav=Gruesome.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_08_echo_Lilith.wav=I was gonna say "cozy."
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_09_echo_Roland.wav=You've strapped charred bandit corpses around the entrance.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_10_echo_Lilith.wav=Corpses can be cozy. Kinda like our place in New Haven, before, uhm...
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_11_echo_Roland.wav=I'm going now.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_12_echo_Lilith.wav=(sighing)...Suave, Lilith.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_13_echo_Roland.wav=So what's the emergen--

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_15_echo_Roland.wav=...You what.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_16_echo_Lilith.wav=I was out hunting, and I found some of that eridium...stuff, and one of those weird worshipper guys sees me. And I chase him down and grab him and he just...
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_17_echo_Roland.wav=Liquified?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_18_echo_Lilith.wav=It was awesome! I dunno if it's cause of the vault opening, or being a Siren, or both -- but this Eridium stuff is the tits.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_19_echo_Roland.wav=You look really pale.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_20_echo_Lilith.wav=Yeah, I passed out a few times. But this could be huge!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_21_echo_Roland.wav=Okay. But why not just send an echo? Why call me out here and increase the risk of Hyperion finding out you're still working with the Crimson Raiders?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_22_echo_Lilith.wav=Uh--uhm, because...you--...how are-- how are you? Doing?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_23_echo_Roland.wav=I'm gonna leave now.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_24_echo_Lilith.wav=Okay.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_25_echo_Lilith.wav=...Jack just left em for dead in the snow, evidently. The Raiders could use the help -- you should track them down.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_26_echo_Roland.wav=Another vault hunter, huh? I'll see if I can contact 'em by ECHO on my way back to Sanctuary. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_27_echo_Lilith.wav=Good! You can go now.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_28_echo_Roland.wav=What? I just got here.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InMemor_29_echo_Lilith.wav=(sarcastic) I'm a little busy waging a one-woman war on every bandit in the tundra so YOU can focus on taking down Jack. But hey, if you wanna hang out, I can just give up this Firehawk thing and let the Bloodshots overrun Sanctuary.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_12_echoX_TinyTina.wav=What was that, Princess? I can't hear you over the sound of Fleshstick's friends. They are being quite rude.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_13_echoX_TinyTina.wav=Another crumpet, Princess?

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_20a_echoX_TinyTina.wav=I read the most EXTRAORDINARY thing the other day, Sir Reginald. Something about slag experimentation -- I forget the details.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_20b_echoX_Fleshstick.wav=Girly, you better let me outta here or I'll skin you ALIVE!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_20c_echoX_TinyTina.wav=Fleshstick! How DARE you interrupt Sir Reginald?!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_21a_echoX_TinyTina.wav=Do you enjoy the tea, Mister Fleshtick? It is imported from the savage lands of the East.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_21b_echoX_Fleshstick.wav=WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT? If you're gonna kill me just get it OVER WITH!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_21c_echoX_TinyTina.wav=Why thank you, Princess Fluffybutt. I rather enjoy its taste myself.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_22_echoX_TinyTina.wav=Dunno why, but that felt pretty good! Pretty ace.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_22a_echoX_TinyTina.wav=Fluffybutt. Sir Reginald. I have heard some salacious rumors about the two of you -- is there any truth to them? 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_22b_echoX_Fleshstick.wav=What the hell is WRONG with you, little girl?!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_22c_echoX_TinyTina.wav=Don't be ridiculous, Fluffybutt -- you can trust me! I shall never gossip!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_23a_echoX_TinyTina.wav=Fleshstick! Let us discuss current affairs.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_23b_echoX_Fleshstick.wav=Let me go let me go let ME GO!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_23c_echoX_TinyTina.wav=Well, that's HARDLY appropriate tea party conversation. Mister Sparks?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_23d_echoX_Fleshstick.wav=(scream of electrocution)
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_24a_echoX_Fleshstick.wav=If you don't stop elecrocuting me, I'm gonna break out of this chair and rip your tongue out with my teeth!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_25a_echoX_TinyTina.wav=Fluffybutt -- you never told me you were getting ENGAGED! Who's the lucky man?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_25b_echoX_Fleshstick.wav=I can't -- I can't breathe --
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_InviteTeaParty_25c_echoX_TinyTina.wav=I must say, darling, you're marrying beneath yourself. You could do much better.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_01_echo_HelenaPierce.wav=We've hijacked the train that runs through The Dust -- if all goes well, we should reach Sanctuary in a day's time. Hyperion hasn't diverted any troops from New Haven to pursue us, and a sandstorm has devoured their nearest frontier town; we just need --Oh, god...everyone! Away from the windows!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_02_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=You've discovered one of Helena Pierce's audio logs! She was a lieutenant in the Crimson Raiders -- the anti-Hyperion resistance. I'd be very interested to know what became of her. If you could find the rest of those audio logs, I would be more than happy to pay you for them.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_03_echo_Jack.wav=Heyyyy, everybody! Jack here!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_04_echo_Wilhelm.wav=DO NOT MOVE.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_05_echo_HelenaPierce.wav=What is the meaning of this?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_06_echo_Jack.wav=I'm sorry, what was your name?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_07_echo_HelenaPierce.wav=Pierce.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_08_echo_Jack.wav=Well, Ms. Pierce -- and please don't break my heart and tell me it's missus Pierce -- this train doesn't belong to you. Wanna turn around and face me, little lady?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_09_echo_HelenaPierce.wav=This train was commandeered legally under the --
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_10_echo_Jack.wav=Holy NUTBALLS what happened to your FACE?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_11_echo_Jack.wav=How about this, lady: you tell me why you look like you headbutted a belt sander, and I'll let all of you go.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_12_echo_HelenaPierce.wav=(Sigh.) My husband gave me a skag pearl ring. The pearl released hunger-inducing pheremones.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_13_echo_Jack.wav=Oh. Oh, gosh...I'm so sorry. Where's your husband now?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_14_echo_HelenaPierce.wav=He's dead.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_15_echo_Jack.wav=Hey, how about that! Somethin' you got in common.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_16_echo_Jack.wav=Hhhhohohohoholycrap! Did you see her head? It was like -- PSHEWWWW! Wilhelm? Kill these savages.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_17_echo_Wilhelm.wav=UNDERSTOOD.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_18_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=These ECHOs shall be most enlightening! 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_JackHere_19_echoX_Hammerlock.wav=Handsome Jack killed her, did he? Shame -- a real shame. Please, return the ECHOs to me whenever you are capable of doing so.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Jimmy_01_echoX_JimmyJenkins.wav=I just wanna be pals!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Jimmy_02_echoX_JimmyJenkins.wav=I don’t mean to hurt nobody!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Jimmy_08_echoX_JimmyJenkins.wav=Jimmy Jenkins! Could you help me find my daddy? I don’t know where he’s gone, but he put up a missing poster in Overlook with his address on it! C-c-c-ould ya find it?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Jimmy_09_echoX_JimmyJenkins.wav=My dad’s out in the Eridium Blight? Yaaay! Just take me to him and he’ll give ya a reward! Jimmy Jenkins!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Jimmy_10_echoX_JimmysDad.wav=You’ve found Jimothy! Oh, my son! I’ve missed you so!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Jimmy_11_echoX_JimmyJenkins.wav=I love you, daddy!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Jimmy_12_echoX_JimmysDad.wav=I built Jimmy after Hyperion turned my real son into a blood pinata. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Jimmy_13_echoX_JimmyJenkins.wav=I have the memories of a dead child!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Jimmy_14_echoX_JimmysDad.wav=That’s right, son. Please, vault hunter, speak to me when you’re ready for your reward.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Jimmy_15_echoX_JimmysDad.wav=I dunno what I’d do without Jimmy. Thank you.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_KillYourself_01_ECHO_Jack.wav=I will pay you to kill youself. I've got a perfect spot all picked out for ya. You don't wanna, that's fine -- call the Hyperion Suicide Prevention Hotline, and you'll get nothing. But if you want  a huge reward, you jump off that cliff and become my bitch. Take your time.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_KillYourself_01a_ECHO_SuicideDude.wav=I'm gonna be RIIIIIIICH!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_KillYourself_02_echo_Jack.wav=Hhhhhhhahahahahaha! I guess you just killed yourself. Head back to the bounty board and I'll pay you. But just -- one second. No matter what happens, or has happened -- you could have killed me by the time you're hearing this, who knows -- I just want you to remember one thing: you are a sellout. You killed yourself because I paid you to. You are my bitch.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_KillYourself_03_echo_HyperionFemale.wav=Thank you for calling the Hyperion Suicide Prevention Hotline. Handsome Jack regrets to inform you that you are a coward.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_KillYourself_04_echo_Jack.wav=Pleasure doin' business with you.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_KillYourself_05_echo_Jack.wav=Didn't kill yourself, huh? Adorable.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_KillYourself_06_echo_Jack.wav=Enjoy your nothing, idiot!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_KillYourself_07_echo_HotlineGuy.wav=Gotta sit down here in the lava, connecting suicide hotline calls for Hyperion cause my only other option is jumping off that lava waterfall and committing suicide. Don't think I don't see the irony. Don't you DARE THINK I DON'T SEE THE IRONY!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_01_live_IncineratorClayton.wav=The Enkindling is almost upon us, torch. But the Firehawk spoke to me in a dream, and demanded another sacrifice --
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_02_ECHO_Lilith.wav= -- No I didn't --
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_03_live_IncineratorClayton.wav=The burning of her favorite son: the midget known as Matchstick. You must take him to the Soaring Dragon in the Southern Shelf, and incinerate him within the jaws of the great mechanical beast who dwells there.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_04_live_Matchstick.wav=I WANT TO SEE THE FLAME! I WANT TO BE WITH THE Firehawk!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_05_live_IncineratorClayton.wav=Matchstick is our most devoted brother -- he's immolated more than a hundred people for the Firehawk, with nothing more than an incendiary pistol and the strength of his belief.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_06_echo_Lilith.wav=A hundred people? Okay, that's impressive. I mean, they were probably just other members of the cult, right? Right?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_07_echo_Lilith.wav=You know, if these guys are really just sitting around burning one another for giggles, maybe we don't have to worry about 'em. That'd be a nice.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_08_live_Matchstick.wav=SHE IS COMING! THE TIME IS ALMOST AT HAND! WE WILL BE TOGETHER, Firehawk! FINALLY, WE'LL BE TOGETHER!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_09_echo_Lilith.wav=Get to the incinerator console and...give him what he wants, I guess.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_10_live_Matchstick.wav=I FEEL YOUR EMBRACE, Firehawk! I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_11_echo_Lilith.wav=...That was kinda weird.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_12_live_IncineratorClayton.wav=Thank you, torch. We shall join Matchstick, soon. The Enkindling approaches.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LightningMatch_13_echo_Lilith.wav=...The what now?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LostTreasure_01a_echo_Brick.wav=Woah. Sounds like that dude was talkin' about the lost bandit treasure of Old Haven. If you find the pieces of the map, you could be the first person to dig it up. Sounds like bandits have the map pieces, but there's no way to know which ones got it -- just keep killin’ bandits and hope for the best! Hahahaha.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LostTreasure_01a_echo_CreepyBandit.wav=They'll never find it. Never find my treasure. Was in Old Haven. Not anymore. Mine. Scatter the map. Give it to bandits. Nobody will ever find it. NEVER!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LostTreasure_02_echo_Brick.wav=Long time ago, there were these guys -- the Crimson Lance -- worked for the Atlas corporation. They tried to kill us. It was pretty funny. That treasure you’re searching for belonged to the last of ‘em.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LostTreasure_02a_echo_Brick.wav=After we killed their general, the remaining Lance either joined us in New Haven or went rogue. The rogue ones set up shop in Old Haven, robbin’ and murderin’ anyone within a turd’s throw of their little city.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LostTreasure_02b_echo_Brick.wav=After a few weeks, Roland and Lilith headed to Old Haven and wiped the rest of the Lance out. The lancemen kept sayin' somethin’ about a treasure of stolen loot they’d stashed somewhere.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LostTreasure_02c_echo_Brick.wav=You got all the map pieces, huh? Looks like you should go to the Caustic Caverns and follow the clues. Everything goes well, you'll be one rich Slab.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_LostTreasure_03_echo_Brick.wav=Hey-hey! You found it! Good goin’.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_01_echoX_Zed.wav=You know what can make a bullet hole, that ain't a bullet? Cause I friggin' don't. I've been seein' some confusin' wounds comin' from Three Horns -- head down there and find out what kinda weapon's causin' em. An old rival of mine named Doc Mercy's usin' it. Don't let the name fool ya -- unlike me, he 's more interested in creatin' wounds than patchin' em up. Also unlike me, he actually has a medical license.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_02_echo_Zed.wav=Now, what in the hell's he got? Looks like you found what's been perforatin' my clientele -- do me a solid and get that gun from ?im.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_03_live_MisterMercy.wav=Keep your mitts off my toy! Finders keepers, losers DIE!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_04_echo_DrZed.wav=What good's yer fancy-pancy med school degree now, huh, Mercy? Good job, vault hunter -- search his body and see if you can't grab that weird-ass gun off him.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_05_echoX_DrZed.wav=I'll be damned -- that’s E-tech!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_06_echoX_DrZed.wav=If I’m gonna treat people shot by E-tech, I’m gonna need way more wounds to practice on. Now that you've got Doc Mercy's E-tech gun, why doncha test it out on the local bandits?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_07_echo_DrZed.wav=So, it looks like that gun uses Eridium tech to turn bullets inta…stuff that ain't bullets. Energy, and stuff. God damn, Eridium is weird.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_08_echo_DrZed.wav=I been doin' some research, and it looks like there's all types of E-tech guns out there for you to find -- blaster rifles, plasma cannons, railguns -- sounds dangerously awesome.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_09_echo_DrZed.wav=Oh, right, I was supposed to be studyin' the effects of these E-tech guns on bandits. Right now it looks like, uh…looks like if you shoot 'em a lot, they die. (beat.) Did I mention I don't have a medical license?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_10_echoX_Zed.wav=Judgin' from this news ECHO I took off one of my patients, it looks like all the weapon manufacturers licensed E-tech from Hyperion for their experimental guns. Guess that explains how Hyperion got so rich off that Eridium after the vault opened.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_11_echo_WaitingRoomPatient.wav=Stop going through my stuff, you quack! I'm bleeding over here!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_12_echoX_Zed.wav=Oh, keep your pants on. Whiner.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MedicalMystery_13_echoX_Zed.wav=Alright, after watching you blast those bandits with that E-tech gun, I've come to a medically sound conclusion: E-tech is friggin' dope. Come on back to me whenever you're done out there.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MightyMorph_01_live_SirHammerlock.wav=Have you heard of these things called...Varkids? Allegedly, the buggers -- that's a pun, you see -- will morph if they take enough damage. Could you take this evolutionary injector, please?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MightyMorph_02_live_SirHammerlock.wav=Lovely. I'd like you to force a few Varkids into morphing. While they're in their cocooned state, hit them with the injector.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MightyMorph_03_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=Good -- now hit it with the injector, please.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MightyMorph_03a_echo_Hammerlock.wav=Some foolish types find Varkids ugly. They're so elegant -- beautiful creatures. Lovely. I long to see one transform.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MightyMorph_04_echo_Hammerlock.wav=Lovely creatures. Beautiful creatures.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MightyMorph_05_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=No no -- you musn't kill it before it transforms.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MightyMorph_06_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=AHH IT'S DISGUSTING KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MightyMorph_07_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=Good lord, that was hideous. Please, bring me a sample of that Varkid's corpse, if you would. If we're to defend against these buggers -- there's that pun again -- we must know all we can about them.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MightyMorph_08_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=I just need a few more samples such as that. Same process as before -- force them to cocoon, hit them with the injector, kill them. Good luck!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MineAllMine_01_echoX_Lilith.wav=A gang of lowlifes is out prospecting for Eridium in the Tundra Express. I want you to find out why they're mining the stuff, and I want 'em dead. Order doesn't matter.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MineAllMine_02_echo_Lilith.wav=You made it to the mine? Good. The miners aren't mutated, so they aren't using the stuff themselves…which means these guys are sending their Eridium somewhere. Kill 'em all and find out where.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MineAllMine_02a_echo_Lilith.wav=Now that you've wiped out the rabble, go find the head miner -- if anybody's got the info I need, it's him.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MineAllMine_03_live_OldProspector.wav=Tarnation!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MineAllMine_04_echo_MisterBlake.wav=The Hyperion Corporation wishes to offer you and your men three thousand dollars for every piece of Eridium delivered. With that kind of money, you could...consume countless alcoholic beverages, or fornicate with numerous members of the opposite, or same, sex. Whatever it is you bandits do.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_MineAllMine_05_echo_Lilith.wav=They made a deal with Hyperion? Hey, don't feel bad wiping these idiots out -- I guarantee you Hyperion woulda done the same after the mine dried up. Go check with Tina -- she's got a job for you.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Minecart_01_echo_Harchek.wav=I will say this only once. Your job is to escort the rock chunk to the mineral smasher, and deliver the Eridium to your supervisor. If you are caught stealing precious minerals from the dig site, you will be shot. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Minecart_02_echo_Tannis.wav=Oh, hang on, that is an antique piece of Dahl machinery -- if you were gazing slackjawed at your feet when Sanctuary flew into the air, you might not know the Dahl corporation held a great interest in Pandora's resources, once upon a time.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Minecart_03_echo_Tannis.wav=Still escorting a minecart due to your egregious over-qualification for menial labor? Fantastic! Let’s hop back to story time. So, the Dahl miners found it difficult to get the Eridium off-planet, and soon found themselves wrestling with the Atlas corporation as they fought over the same resources. As it turns out, word of a Vault can travel many galaxies.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Minecart_03a_echo_Tannis.wav=As it turns out, Dahl turned tail when the Crimson Lance showed up and flexed their various muscles. The central issue being that Dahl brought many workers here, including myself, and left without evacuating most of us. The bandits you fight out there used to be family men, workers, scientists… (a beat into actual realization) We’re all broken because of them.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_NameGame_01_echoX_SirHammerlock.wav="Bully-mong". Rubbish name, isn’t it?  I’d like a better one before my almanac goes to print. Search some Bullymong bone piles, will you? I'll learn something about their diets, and come up with a catchier name for the beasts.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_NameGame_02_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=Hrm -- it seems  Bullymongs use those mounds to dispose of their refuse. That suggests a primate-level intelligence -- that's it! I shall call them primal beasts! I'll run it by my publishers -- in the meantime, blow up some Primal Beasts with grenades, would you? See how the new name works for you.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_NameGame_03_echoX_SirHammerlock.wav=What if we called them Ffferovores? Because they’re the most ferocious creatures I’ve ever seen, and I say that having watched a tyrant rip my arm from its socket. Repressed memories, ho! I’ll have to run it by my publishers -- in the meantime, loot a few Bullymong piles so I can learn about their diets.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_NameGame_04_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=Rrgh! My publishers despise “Primal Beast.” Bloody uncultured...alright, what about Ffferovores? They’re the most ferocious creatures I’ve ever seen, and I say that having watched a Thresher rip my arm from its socket. Repressed memories, ho! Anyway, take the new name for a spin -- shoot some of the Ferovore's projectiles out of the air, see how the name thrills you.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_NameGame_05_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=Bloody balls! “Ferovore” is trademarked! RRGH! Sod it!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_OverMedMan_07_echoX_Karima.wav=G-great! You’re very efficient -- I respect that. The last medicine shipment was being delivered by boat, but we lost contact. Find it, p-please.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_OverMedMan_09_echoX_Karima.wav=You got all the medicine! Efficient -- very efficient. Now, please d-d-distribute that medicine around the town? I’d do it myself, but Hyperion doesn’t...doesn’t like it when we leave our homes.

Get--there you go, Blue! We're calling it Blue cause of the color its, uh -- yeah.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_SplinterGroup_02_echo_Tannis.wav=Keep what few wits you have about you. These mutants are not to be trifled with -- cut them no slack.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_SplinterGroup_02a_echo_Tannis.wav=You must  communicate with the beasts through the intercom. Should your promises of food satisfy them, they will let you in.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_SplinterGroup_02c_echo_Tannis.wav=The mutants cannot resist the smell of that congealed lump of cheese and self-loathing. Once they appear, kill them, and bring me proof that you have done so.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_SplinterGroup_03_echo_Tannis.wav=Excellent. Return to me: I have a large pile of blood money with your name on it. You might assume this to be a metaphor. You would be incorrect.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_SplinterGroup_04_echo_Tannis.wav=It is unfortunate the mutants could not be tamed -- they would have been useful allies.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_SplinterGroup_05_echoX_Dan.wav=What the hell -- you're not June! Get 'em, dudes!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_SplinterGroup_1a_echoX_Tannis.wav=Good. The escapees, for whatever reason, find pizza irresistible. You will lure them out with this pizza, then murder them.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_StalkStalk_01_echoX_SirHammerlock.wav=An old boyfriend of mine, name of Taggart, was hired to wipe out the Stalker population a while back. He also, adorably, tried to write a book about his adventures in the Highlands. You find the chapters of his book, and I'll plagiarize the living daylights out of them for mine. Win-win-win, as they say! Nobody says that. I say it.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_StalkStalk_02_echo_TaggartTheHuntsman.wav=Chapter one. Today, I punched a Stalker so hard it turned inside out. (long pause.) End of chapter one.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_StalkStalk_02a_echo_SirHammerlock.wav=It is a known fact that Stalkers find ECHO recorders delicious. You'll likely find the rest of Taggart's chapters within piles of Stalker defecation. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_StalkStalk_03_echo_TaggartTheHuntsman.wav=Chapter two. Jack wasn't kidding: these Stalker things are somethin'. I pounded one right in the throat with my thumpin' hammer -- just like mom taught me -- and it pretty much exploded. It made this hilarious noise like: (Taggart makes a terrifying noise)Kinda like that. Should make that my ringtone.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_StalkStalk_04_echo_TaggartTheHuntsman.wav=Chapter three. My boys found out the Stalkers don't cloak so well once their shields are down. They get all panicky, start roaring to power up their friends -- it's cute. I saw a huge Stalker staring at our camp the other day -- I decided to name her Henry-- (we hear Taggart'sringtone go off -- it's the exact horrifying noise he made in the first ECHO log.)Heyyyyyyyy, mom! No, I was just saying I named a Stalker after ya.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_StalkStalk_05_echo_TaggartTheHuntsman.wav=(nervously)Chapter four. Everything's fine. Henry and his stalker friends took out my team and stole the SPECIAL mother's day present that I HAND-MADE, but hell with it -- I'm headin' out there and I'm getting my damn mother's day present back. Jack as my witness, this will be the best. Mother's day. EVER!
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_StalkStalk_06_echo_TaggartTheHuntsman.wav=Chapter--f...chapterfff...Henry ate my hands...she chewed them off in front of me and I swear to Jack...the spiky bitch laughed as she did it. Mom, I just don't know what to-- No! Get away, Henry! No, Henry! Get ba-- mommy! Mommy! MOMMMMMMYYYYYYY! (we hear Taggart being dragged away as he screams.)
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_StalkStalk_07__SirHammerlock.wav=Eaten, was he? Suppose there's a lesson to be learned in all of this. He who attempts to fight nature will?get?eaten. Sounded much more poignant in my head. Apologies.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_02_echo_Claptrap.wav=The statues are bulletproof? You win this round, inanimate object! Minion, I need you to search the Opportunity drop zone for a deactivated constructor. Then you can use it to cut through the statues for you!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_06_echo_Claptrap.wav=Alright! The constructor's working again! Make sure to protect it while it's wreckin' the statues.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_17_echo_Jack.wav=(Sigh.) What are you doing now, tool? Petty vandalism? That's how far you've fallen? Really, it's just sad.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_18_echo_Jack.wav=Okay. You made your point. You don't like the statue. I look a little too badass with my foot on that bandit's face, and you're jealous. I get it, alright?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_19_echo_Jack.wav=Got it out of your system? That feel good? Great. Now go home and stop screwin' with my stuff, or we're gonna have a problem.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_20_echo_Jack.wav=I can actually see why you'd wanna tear that particular statue down. Clearly, you're illiterate, and the image of me enjoying a good book just makes your head hurt somethin' awful. 
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_21_echo_Jack.wav=You know what book I'm reading in that image? It's called "101 ways to forcibly make vandals eat their own entrails." I'll let you borrow it sometime.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_23_echo_Jack.wav=Oh come ON -- what's wrong with that statue? I'm holding the Vault Key, and a BABY. You know what babies are, right? Those little pink things your kind eats after you're done rolling around in your own feces?
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_24_echo_Jack.wav=I get it. You're one of those conspiracy theorists. "Muhhh, Handsome Jack didn't really open the Vault, he stole the key, wake up sheeple."  I thought I'd already killed off the rest of you tinfoil hat-wearing pricks.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_26_echo_Jack.wav=What is this even ACCOMPLISHING? Are you just trying to piss me off? Was that your goal? Well mission accomplished, jaggoff. When I'm curbstomping your dumb ass to death, you can take solace in the fact that, one time, for like, eight seconds, you mildly irritated me. Good for you.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_27_echo_Jack.wav=Go ahead. Knock the last one down. I've already got a great idea for a new statue. It's just gonna be me, kicking you in the junk. I'm gonna commission like fifteen of those sumbitches and put them everywhere.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Statuesque_29_echo_Claptrap.wav=Now that you're done with that bot, it's time for some fun. You ever seen a Constructor bot dance, minion? Cause you're about to! Hit that other button to activate his dancing subroutines!

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Surgery_02_echoX_DrZed.wav=(sighing) That shard ain't no good in the black market -- it isn't refined yet. You could probly take it to that Tannis lady on the other side of the town -- she's real into that Eridium stuff, when she ain't  actin' all hoity-toity cause she's got a "real" doctorate. Oh, and lemme know if you're lookin' for work -- I got stuff needs doin'.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Surgery_03_echoX_Tannis.wav=As I've said, Roland, now that Jack has the Vault Key, it is only a matter of time until he opens the Vault. Also, I require a new ventilator -- this lab smells of bacon. Bacon is for sycophants, and products of incest.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Surgery_04_echoX_Tannis.wav=Wait, you're not Roland, or even of close facial symmetry. However, you've brought Eridium, and thus I can feel my loins skitter forth from retirement. Oh, don’t give me "overshare" face! Hand it over.
Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Surgery_05_echoX_Tannis.wav=After hours of scientific insanity you could only imagine in your dreams or my bed, standing offer, I have deduced that Jack, the vault key, and the Eridium are all connected on a deeper level.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_Swallowed_06_echoX_Scooter.wav=Thanks again, man! That catch-a-ride hackin' you did is all in the past. I definitely will not kill you, probably.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ThisJustIn_07_echo_HunterHellquist.wav=Today marks a historic occasion, listeners -- the day order came to Pandora. After heroically opening the Vault and destroying the evil inside, our beloved leader Handsome Jack  dispatched miners, surveyors, soldiers and engineers to the savage border planet. Jack wishes to assure the populace that Hyperion will bring peace and order to the lawless hell that Pandora has become. Bandits? Psychos? These will be a thing of the past. With Hyperion in charge, Pandora can look forward to a very bright future, indeed.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_ThisJustIn_09_echo_HunterHellquist.wav=Today, Hyperion struck a great blow against the bandit hordes of Pandora. The terrorist stronghold of New Haven is in ashes. Thanks to the work of a courageous informant known as Shep Sanders, Hyperion infiltrated the town shortly before daybreak this morning. The Hyperion troops, led, of course, by Handsome Jack, managed to capture the bandit known as Brick, and execute the terrorist witch known as Lilith. Today is truly...a great day.

Voices\English(US)\VOSQ_UncleTed_01_echo_Una.wav=Thanks for accepting my job. Hyperion robbed my uncle Teddy and sent him to die on this armpit of a planet. I need you to search his cabin in the Arid Nexus for something I can use to avenge his death.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_CaptFlynt_Glacial_Water_Speaker_08.wav=If you see a Goliath, do not remove his helmet. Keep him happy with a few nudie mags and a steak or two, and keep your damned distance.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_NPC_Mumble_07.wav=So great to be in Sanctuary. All of my friends are here, like Roland! Even though he did help Hyperion wipe out my product line after the robolution. But still -- if I refused someone's friendship just because they were a mass murderer, I wouldn't have any friends at ALL!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_NPC_Mumble_08.wav=I used to be somebody. Granted, that "somebody" was an insane, megalomaniacal revolutionary who wanted to destroy all of humanity and over-used air quotes, but at least I was respected! (beat.) No I wasn't. Sigh.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_NPC_Mumble_09.wav=(making a really upbeat song out of it) Sad and lonely, sad and lonely -- lonely and sad! I got no friends but that's okay, cause at least I got…uh…hands. Hands and no friends, hands and no friends, that's the life for meeee.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_NPC_Mumble_10.wav=AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Sorry. I was just thinking about the horrors I've seen since coming to Pandora. Won't happen again, I promise. (beat.) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Dang. My bad.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_NPC_Mumble_12.wav=It's a heck of a burden, being the last of your kind. Never will I hear the laugh of another Claptrap. Or dance alongside one. Or be tied to a pole and tortured with hot pokers by one because somebody reprogrammed its friend-or-foe priorities. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_NPC_Mumble_13.wav=I wonder if there are any other Claptraps out there who survived Jack's recall. I wonder what I'd say to them if we ever met. (beat.) Actually, I'd probably just tell them to shove off. There's only room enough for ONE dancing robot with a comedically divisive personality around here, and it's me!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_NPC_Mumble_14.wav=Anybody wanna check me out? Watch me dance? Listen to me tell you that there are new missions available on a bounty board? (beat) Heavy sigh.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_Quest_UI_Idle_04.wav=I love you. What? Who said that? I didn’t say anything.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_Quest_UI_Idle_05.wav=Did you know my head is at your crotch level? I'm trying not to think about it.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_Quest_UI_Idle_07.wav=You make me so proud, minion. The way you're carrying on my fight against Handsome Jack -- it brings a tear to my eye. A figurative one, of course. The saline content of actual tears would rust my eye quicker than you could say "tetanus shot."
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_Quest_UI_Idle_08.wav=How you feelin', minion? You feelin' good? I'm feelin' good.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_Quest_UI_Idle_09.wav=You know, this whole last-of-my-kind thing isn't so bad. Gives me a lot of "me" time, you know? Time to think things over, defrag my hard drive, wonder if there is a robot heaven and, if so, whether my Claptrap brethren are in it -- you know, stuff like that. It involves lots of crying.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Claptrap_Quest_UI_Idle_10.wav=Looking good, minion!

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_BrickMordy2_01_Brick.wav=Explain it to me again.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_BrickMordy2_02_Mordecai.wav=(sigh.) Like I said – instead of punching, I prefer to keep my distance from the target, pick my moment, and kill them with a single, well-placed shot.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_BrickMordy2_03_Brick.wav=You lost me at “instead of punching.”
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_BrickMordy3_01_Brick.wav=Sorry about Bloodwing, mordy.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_Glacial_Water_Speaker3_01_CaptFlynt.wav=A few of you have asked me why I keep playing these pre-recorded messages on a loop. Well, I've got a great answer for you: a red-hot poker to the eye. Isn't that right, Claptrap?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_Glacial_Water_Speaker3_02_Claptrap.wav=IT WAS JUST A QUESTION, MISTER FLYNT!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_Glacial_Water_Speaker3_03_CaptFlynt.wav=That's Captain Flynt to you.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_Hyperion_Radio_11_Jack.wav=Hyperion makes the most accurate, high-quality weapons in the six galaxies. If you wanna grow up to be big and strong like your old pal Handsome Jack, you better start practicing your marksmanship now!

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_MayaA_07_Angel.wav=They're an order of monks who rule the planet of Athenas. The earliest surveillance footage I can find is from four years ago.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_MayaA_14_Maya.wav=For years, you've said I'd be out there exploring -- not...smiling and giving speeches.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_MayaB_05_Maya.wav=Yeah! It sounds incredible. But this archaeologist says that Sirens have some sort of connection to Eridium, and the vaults --
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_MayaB_06_BrotherSophis.wav=Maya, that's enough --
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_MayaB_07_Maya.wav=If I travelled to Pandora, I could learn even more about my Siren lineage --
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_MayaB_08_BrotherSophis.wav=That's ENOUGH! (beat.) We have fed you. Trained you. Protected you. The people of Athenas look to the Order of the Impending Storm for guidance and protection. If you were to leave, this planet would be defenseless.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_MayaD_04_Maya.wav=SHUT UP! You didn't want me to protect this planet! You wanted me to keep it scared, keep me locked up so these people would do what you asked. Nobody's gonna disobey the Order if they've gotta face the wrath of a Siren -- is that it?!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_MayaD_05_BrotherSophis.wav=You know nothing! Child, you have SO much left to learn! You --
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_MayaD_06_Maya.wav=Don't. Call me. "Child." Everyone, get outta here! You have nothing to fear from the order anymore -- I'm leaving.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_SalA_04_Jack.wav=Woah --Run that by me again?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Conv_MapEcho_SalA_05_Angel.wav=Only one member of the occupation force made it back alive. He has two broken legs, he lost an arm, and sunstroke seems to have driven him completely insane. But...he keeps saying one name, over and over.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Jack_Hyperion_CitySpeak_04.wav=Citizens of Opportunity! You represent the beginning of a grand adventure. Opportunity is only the FIRST Hyperion city on Pandora. One day you'll be saying, "bandits? What's a bandit? I can't hear what you're saying over the motor of this free blowjob machine Jack gave all of us."

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Jack_Radio_01.wav=Haaaaaaandsome Jack here. When I opened the Vault and destroyed the Destoyer inside -- ironic, I know -- I had a Hyperion weapon in my hand. When I cleaned up the frontier and burned the bandit settlement of New Haven to the ground, it was a Hyperion pistol I held in my fist. And every day, as I watch over this planet, as its protector, as its champion, as its hero, it’s Hyperion firearms I put my trust in. Hell, that’s why I bought the company in the first place. This is Handsome Jack, signing off. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Jack_Radio_02.wav=This is Handsome Jack, reminding you that we at Hyperion are still offering bounties for Pandora’s most wanted.

We’re also still offering six billion dollars for the capture of the ex-Underdome star known as Mordecai, as well as a smaller reward for the capture of his bird, Bloodwing -- oh, sorry. I read that backwards. It’s six billion for the bird, twenty bucks for the has-been. My mistake. And, as always, I am personally willing to offer thirty billion dollars for the capture of the bandit leader known Roland -- double that if you use Hyperion weapons to bring him down. Oh, and stop contacting us with questions regarding the bounty on the freak known as “Lilith.” The fugitive was confirmed dead months ago, alright? Handsome Jack, signing off.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Jakobs_Radio_01.wav=We at the Jakobs corporation have held to certain values through the years. Simple things, like family. Honor. Always aiming for the head. A Jakobs man ignores the mockin' words of the ignorant. 'Yer gun's too slow,' they say. 'Yer accuracy ain't nothin' to write home about.' And the Jakobs man nods. Walks away. Decapitates 'em with a single shot. Jakobs. A family company.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Jakobs_Radio_02.wav=Montgomery Jakobs here. When I was a young boy, my grandfather gave me a piece of advice I’ll never forget. “Grandson,” he said, “there’s only one thing in this world more satisfyin’ than the love of a fine woman, or the taste of a hand-rolled cee-gar. And that’s splittin’ a man’s head in two with a single bullet.” Down through the generations, the Jakobs company has held true to those words. My family believes all the accuracy in the world don’t mean a great deal if you don’t got the power to back it up. Hence our family creed: if it took more’n one shot...you weren’t usin’ a Jakobs.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Jakobs_Radio_03.wav=This is Montgomery Jakobs here to tell you that before my grandfather was unjustly villified for his views on Truxican immigration, he considered himself the luckiest man in the six systems. For he wasn’t just a weapons manufacturer -- he was the head of a family. Every courageous lawman who ever put a bandit in the dirt with the help of a Jakobs rifle, every humble homesteader who reaches for their Jakobs revolver when they hear rustling in the night -- they’re all a part of the Jakobs family. Won’t you join us, too?

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Maliwan_Radio_01.wav=The Voice of the Maliwan corporation speaks. The hordes stand assembled, frothing at the mouth. Thirsty for blood. They know not of the terror they shall feel, the beautiful destruction that will befall them. For in the hands of their ostensible victim, polished to a sheen and wielding the power of every element under the sun, lies a Maliwan rifle. The Deus Ex Arma. The god in the weapon. Maliwan.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Maliwan_Radio_02.wav=Combat is an art. Maliwan weapons are the paint. Our elemental tech transforms the battlefield from a cacophony of idiocy, into a masterpiece of destruction; the unwashed hordes will burn, and fry, and melt, into a portrait of exquisite death. Maliwan. Beauty through destruction.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Maliwan_Radio_03.wav=Maliwan is pleased to offer technologically advanced weapons for the more...discerning warrior. Every Maliwan gun places the power of the elements in your hands -- the elegance of their form matched only by the deadliness of their tech. Maliwan. Where form meets function.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_AridNexus_01_Jack.wav=Angel, get this message to whomever’s organizing the construction out in the Nexus. No matter what happens, make sure that old bandit town -- Fyrestone, I think it’s called -- make sure it stays standing. That pissant little rest stop is where it all began. Oh, and another thing: I want it on company policy that instead of “Fyrestone,” we’re changing its name to “Jackville.” Really twist the knife for those bandit bastards, you know what I mean? I want those Vault Hunting bandits to see what I’ve done to this place -- I want it to stand as a testament to their failure. They couldn’t protect New Haven, they couldn’t protect Fyrestone, and they’re sure as hell not gonna protect Sanctuary.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_AridNexus_02_Jack.wav=Guys, I’ve heard rumblings amongst the workers that our Eridium mining operatins are “ravaging” this planet. Ya know, I assume you’re saying this because most of you didn’t see what Pandora looked like before we showed up. You know what they called this place? The Badlands. It was a dry, dusty pisshole where dreams went to die. Now there’s pipes, full of beautiful Eridium, technologically advanced machines, goddamn volcanos -- I mean, who doesn’t love volcanos? They’re mountains that explode fire. That's literally the definition of the word awesome. Am I -- am I right?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_AridNexus_03_Zed.wav=Hey, Roland. This is Zed. Thought you might wanna know -- some guy from the, uh, Hyperion corporation came by -- name of Blake. Said you’d dealt with him during the Claptrap uprising. Anyway, he offered me a pretty penny for my place here in Fyrestone. Was real insistent that I take the money and run. It’s probly nothin’, but there was just somethin’ about him that put me on edge, you know? I’ma stay here for the meantime, though -- I ain’t in no hurry to leave my shop.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_AridNexus_04_Zed.wav=Roland. Zed. If you’re receivin’ this, respond as soon as you can. Blake came back again, today and showed me some faked pictures of New Haven -- the city was burnin, lotta people were dead. Blake said that his boss burned the place to the ground when everyone livin’ there wouldn’t move out. Course, I know those pictures had to be faked cause you and the rest of your pals were holed up in New Haven, and you woulda stopped those troops from takin’ the town, right? ...I mean, right?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_AridNexus_05_Zed.wav=Heya, Roland. I appreciate your offer to move into Sanctuary, but I got a lot of stuff here in Fyrestone. Sanctuary sounds nice and all, but...Fyrestone’s my home. I made my decision -- if I’m gonna die, I’m gonna die in the city I was born -- Fyresto--

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Bloodshot_03_Flanksteak.wav=Bloodshots: Roland’s raiders are tearin’ us up. Their guns are just too damned good. But I’ve come up with a solution to this problem: sack the hell up and stop dying all the goddamn time! And quit suggesting we buy guns from that Marcus jaggoff -- he lives in Sanctuary, so he’s just as much of a double-crossing, holier-than-thou JACKASS as Roland and his raiders. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Bloodshot_04_Marcus.wav=Hey, Bloodshots! I notice you’re not buying any of my guns. Maybe you’re worried my wares aren’t deadly enough for you. With that in mind, please accept this complimentary crate of Marcus Munitions weaponry. If you like what you find, maybe we can make a deal! “Once you go Marcus Munitions, you’ll never go back...us munitions.”
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Bloodshot_05_BloodshotBandit.wav=Flanksteak! FLANKSTEAK! Can you -- can you BELIEVE these guns Marcus gave us?! There’s a shotgun in here that shoots FIRE! GODDAMNED FIRE! I been usin’ it to roast my food and girlfriends -- Marcus is a -- is a GOD! Me and the boys got an idea -- a good idea, you see? Great idea. We build him a shrine. Big shrine. Beautiful shrine. And he’ll keep givin’ us guns. More guns! MORE GUNS! MORE GUUUUNS!

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Dust_01_TectorHodunk.wav=Hey, Little Linda Loo -- I heard you askin’ why we gotsta kill Zafords. Two reasons, baby. First reason? Generations ago, a skagsuckin’ bastard named Connor Zaford took advantage of Grandma Hodunk, then nearly kilt her to keep things quiet. He used his big, green fangs to rip into her flesh, over and over. And we Hodunks can’t forgive a sin like that, can we? That’s the first reason we kill ‘em, sweetie. The second reason’s that if you don’t, we’ll have shoot you right between your purdy little blue eyes for goin’ against the family. And none of us want that, do we?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Dust_02_MickZaford.wav=Oi -- rednecks! I hear you’re spreadin’ lies about the Zaford-Hodunk war again. Scarin’ yer little kids with stories about grandma-eatin’ boogeymen and the like. Well lemme give ya the only bit of education you backbirthed teatsuckers will ever hear: your family started da feud. Yer Great Grandpap Lyle Hodunk stole two Zaford children and drowned ‘em in a creekbed. Just fer fun. We’ll honor the truce as long as you hill-bills do, but never forget the Hodunks fired the first shot in this war. And never doubt that the Zafords will fire the last.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Dust_03_Moxxi.wav=Ellie, sweetheart -- when are you gonna come back to Sanctuary? I know you’re angry. I’m not going to apologize for what I said, but...it’s not safe out there. Both of those dumbass families think the other started their clan feud -- neither of them knows the war actually started thanks to a big misunderstanding regarding a bar tab and a stock car race. Long story -- maybe I’ll tell you sometime. The point is, the truce between the Zafords and the Hodunks can only last so long -- sooner or later war will break out again, and you do not want to be in the middle of it. Trust me, sugar -- you don’t have the constitution for it.  But hey -- if you’d prefer to live near a bunch of bandits who want you dead, rather than stay with your mother who, god forbid, wants you to care about your appearance, that’s your decision to make. (beat.) But it’s the wrong one. Just come back, honey.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Frostburn_01_IncineratorClayton.wav=The sky lit up with fire, and blood, and bullets, and screaming. One of our scouts came back from his morning patrol exactly as he usually did, except this time he was on fire. His skin was black and crisp, his vocal chords cooked. As we circled around his smoking form, ready to divvy up his loot, he shrieked one word with his last ounce of breath: Firehawk.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Frostburn_02_IncineratorClayton.wav=No one has seen the Firehawk, but we feel its presence everywhere. The Bloodshots -- those disgusting marauders who operate out of the old Dahl dam -- mounted raids on the gates of Sanctuary for weeks. Until, suddenly, they stopped -- I see scorch marks all around the Bloodshot camps. No human could stop the Bloodshots so completely, so violently, so...beautifully. No one but a god could accomplish such a feat.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Frostburn_03_IncineratorClayton.wav=As I see the aftermath of the Firehawk’s war on the Bloodshots, I finally understand -- the Firehawk is everywhere. The Firehawk is  a god of justice. A god of vengeance, and rage, and hate, and death, and beauty. It watches us from on high, and it punishes the wicked. We must pay homage -- we must pay homage. We must fear the Firehawk. Respect the Firehawk. Worship the Firehawk.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_01_Jack.wav=Hi there! This is a message from Handsome Jack, to the construction workers of Opportunity. You fine gentlemen are building the future -- once the city is done and its carefully selected citizens are brought in, you’ll be able to see the true beauty that Opportunity represents. From a distance, that is -- you guys aren’t coming anywhere near this city once it’s done. You can check it out from, like binoculars, or something.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_02_BoardMember.wav=But why would you build a metropolis in the middle of a bandit-infested wasteland? I don’t understand, sir.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_03_Jack.wav=Of course you don’t. Because you’re as lacking in vision as you are in brain cells. You don’t do things because they’re easy. You do them because they’re right--
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_04_BoardMember.wav=--But sir, I’m...that still didn’t really explain anyth--
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_05_Jack.wav=Opportunity is the tip of the spear, people. The future is coming to Pandora, and Opportunity is the bright, shining beacon of that future. Bandits will look up from their baby-meat stew and see our city shining in the distance. A symbol of safety, and peace, and order. First, Opportunity. Then, the rest of Pandora. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_06_BoardMember.wav=But sir, do you really expect families to bring their children to this city?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_07_Jack.wav=I can’t say for sure, Keith, but I’m loathe to take advice on children from someone who doesn’t have any.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_09_Jack.wav=That's the thing – you don't. Not anymore.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_10_Jack.wav=Alright, let's  weapons, everybody.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_11_FemaleBoardMember.wav=Well, weapon sales have skyrocketed since the opening of the Vault --
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_12_Jack.wav=No No no. I’m talking style. You look at our guns -- what do they offer?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_13_FemaleBoardMember.wav=Increased accuracy, stablizers --
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_14_Jack.wav=Class, sweetheart. They offer class. You buy from those war hippies at Maliwan, the gun’s named like “the Fervid Gospel” or “the Guileless Provocateur” -- some pretentious crap. You get a bandit gun, they can’t even spell “pistol” right. When you look at the names of those guns, you feel like a dumbass. When you look at a Hyperion gun, I want you to feel classy.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_15_FemaleBoardMember.wav=Uhm, okay, sir. How do propose we accomplish --
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Opportunity_16_Jack.wav=Synergy. Dynamicism. Longitudinal. Words with heft. Words with meaning. Words that evidently nobody in this room understands given the blank looks you troglodytes are giving me right now. Look -- when you pick up a Hyperion shotgun called the Projectile Diversification, you’ll know it was made by smart sonsofbitches, for smart sonsofbitches. Jesus is anybody writing this down? I'm giving you gold here, people. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Sanctuary_01_Jack.wav=Hey, Roland. Handsome Jack here –  'member me? My men kicked your bandit asses out of New Haven and killed your little pal Lilith. Ringin’ any bells? Anyway, I hear you and the rest of your little buddies have relocated to Sanctuary. Just wanted to congratulate ya – you’ve successfully delayed your deaths by a few months. I’m gonna be real busy mining Eridium to charge that Vault Key I stole from your buddy Tannis, so you guys are gonna be low on my priority list for a while. So Ciao!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Sanctuary_02_Roland.wav=This is a message to any Crimson Lance left on Pandora. General Knoxx is dead, and knowing the Lance, they're more likely to cut their losses and leave you here than send an extraction ship. So unless you wanna starve to death out there, you've got two options. One: you become bandits. Two: you join me in protecting the people of Sanctuary. I can offer you food, shelter, and the chance to fight for something real, something meaningful -- a chance I know the Atlas corporation never gave you. Roland, out.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Sanctuary_03_Roland.wav=Lancemen -- attention! I have only one question to ask of you all. One question. Just a few years ago, we were enemies. But that time has passed. As glad as I am to see you all in Sanctuary, I know you wouldn’t have come if you had any other option. I know how bad things are out there. I know how Jack’s army has swept across this planet like a sandstorm, ripping apart everything in its way. When I joined the Crimson Lance years ago, they told me I’d be fighting to protect those who couldn’t protect themselves. But you all know as well as I do -- that was a lie. But this fight, against Hyperion? It isn’t. If we don’t band together -- if we can’t protect this city from Jack’s army -- then we’re done for. I am Roland, and I only have one question to ask: ARE YOU WITH ME?!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Sanctuary_04_CrowdWalla.wav=(cheers)
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MapEcho_Sanctuary_05_Roland.wav=If you can hear this and you're sane enough to understand what I'm saying, head to Sanctuary. I don't care what Jack's told you, or how well-defended you think you are  -- the Hyperion army is coming to wipe you out. If you wanna survive, you get a gun, you come to Sanctuary...and you join the Crimson Raiders.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MaskGuy_NPC_Activate_01.wav=Behind Jack's mask, there is a tiny alien controlling the robot structure that is Handsome Jack.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MaskGuy_NPC_Activate_02.wav=Once you take off Jack's mask, you'll find out he's actually Scooter in disguise.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MaskGuy_NPC_Activate_03.wav=Under Jack's mask? A tiny Rakk Hive.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MaskGuy_NPC_Activate_04.wav=Under Jack's mask is his horribly disfigured twin, Ugly Mac. He killed Jack and took his face.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MaskGuy_NPC_Activate_09.wav=Jack's mask is actually the door to a tiny vault that you can enter like a portal.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MaskGuy_NPC_Activate_10.wav=Personally I don't buy Jack's mask. The face stapling thing he's got is super-unrealistic. There's just no way his facial skin would stay attached if it was just stapled in a few places and shrinking in other places. The guy's face would rot away and he would die from a septic shock.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MaskGuy_NPC_Mumble_01.wav=What's underneath his mask?

Still, it’s a nice change of pace from the abbey -- at least here, the bad guys stab you from the front. I haven’t found a shred of info about Sirens -- the closest I’ve got to a lead on Siren history are legends of an alien Vault. It’s not much to go on, but it’s something -- maybe if I find this Vault I’ll find out where the hell Sirens come from. Or maybe I’ll prove Brother Harker right and take a bullet to the head five minutes from now. We’ll see how my week goes.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_NPC_RolandDead_During_02.wav=How's that mission goin'?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_NPC_RolandDead_During_03.wav=That quest going okay?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_NPC_RolandDead_Idle_01.wav=Roland was the best of us. To be shot in the back by a goddamned coward…amigo, I'm not gonna be done until I've wiped every last Hyperion grunt off the face of this planet.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_NPC_RolandDead_Idle_02.wav=After Roland…after Bloodwing…I'll do whatever it takes to burn Hyperion to the ground. Even if it costs me my life. It's what Roland woulda done.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_NPC_RolandDead_Idle_03.wav=Even without Jack, Hyperion's still a threat. I won't rest until they're gone for goddamned good.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_Turn_In_02.wav=Nice job.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_Turn_In_03.wav=Good goin' out there.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_UI_Idle_01.wav=Between you and me, there are three things you gotta know: you can't trust Marcus, Tannis means well, and no matter how much you tip her, Moxxi will not sleep with you. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_UI_Idle_02.wav=Hey, has Moxxi talked about me lately? Eh, forget I asked.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_UI_Idle_03.wav=Much as I hate to admit it, Hyperion's got the best sniper rifles if you're into that sort of thing. That said, could be fun to bust Jack's melon with one of his own guns.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_UI_Idle_04.wav=Hey. I wanted to tell you -- don't feel bad about Bloodwing. You did everything you could. None of it was…none of that was your fault.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_UI_Idle_05.wav=Jack's gonna pay, amigo. Believe you me -- Jack's gonna pay.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_UI_Idle_06.wav=I used to sit on the sidelines of the resistance. Deliver intel, get paid. No more. It's all or nothing now.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_UI_Idle_07.wav=Pandora ain't gonna be free until we end this, amigo.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_UI_Idle_08.wav=Shame we couldn't have met before Jack took over. Woulda liked havin' you by my side when we took out Crawmerax.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_UI_Idle_09.wav=If you're lookin' for power, you can't beat a Jakobs sniper rifle. Recoil's a real bitch, though.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Mordecai_Quest_UI_Idle_10.wav=Bloodwing was one of a kind, you know? Never knew what species she was -- I found her back in the, uh…ah, hell with it. That's a long story.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_CoS_Arena_Intro_01.wav=Hey, sugar. The underdome may be gone, but that doesn’t mean I can’t put on a show. I’ve got a fella named Fink running one of my Circles of Slaughter. Go check it out -- you might like it.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_NPC_Credits_01.wav=And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for….the CREDITS!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_During_01.wav=You finished with that little somethin-somethin I asked you about?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_During_02.wav=You still working on one of my jobs?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_During_03.wav=How're you doing with that job I sent you on?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_New_01.wav=I've got just the thing for ya.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_New_02.wav=Hey, sugar. I got somethin' for ya.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_New_03.wav=Wanna help me out?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_No_New_01.wav=Aw, sorry, sweetie. No work today.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_No_New_02.wav=I don't have any work, but that doesn't mean you can't stay.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_No_New_03.wav=No new jobs. Shame -- I love to watch you work.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_NPC_Mumble_01.wav=That's…interesting.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_NPC_Mumble_02.wav=(tired sigh)
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_NPC_Mumble_03.wav=I really need to clean this place.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_NPC_Mumble_04.wav=It's been a long day.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_NPC_Mumble_05.wav=Dangit.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_NPC_Reminder_01.wav=Hey, sugar -- wanna help a lady out? Stop by my bar in Sanctuary and I'll give you a job.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_Turn_In_01.wav=You're the best!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_Turn_In_02.wav=Can't thank you enough, sugar.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_Turn_In_03.wav=Thanks for finishin' that job, darlin'.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_UI_Idle_01.wav=Like what you see?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_UI_Idle_02.wav=You know, you're not like the others -- I can throw out a saucy innuendo and an animal noise at these goons and they're putty in my hands. But you? You're made of…firmer stuff. Mee-ow.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_UI_Idle_03.wav=I'm a bit tired, so just imagine I said something incredibly suggestive, will you? 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_UI_Idle_04.wav=Take your time, sugar.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_UI_Idle_05.wav=Honey, I've got all day.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_Quest_UI_Idle_06.wav=If you're not in the mood for a mission, you can always try out one of my slot machines. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_01.wav=Oh, you sweet thing.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_02.wav=Always love a good tip.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_03.wav=Haha...you’re gonna make me blush.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_04.wav=Tiger growl.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_05.wav=You keep that up, I might just have to pay you back somehow.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_06.wav=Just when I thought you couldn’t get any more attractive.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_07.wav=Spending all that money on little old me? I’m flattered.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_08.wav=I haven’t seen someone throw that much money around since...my last boyfriend.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_09.wav=Hell, I’m all wet. I mean -- I spilled a drink. Before you came in. Not cause you tipped me. Good god, I’m not that easy.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_10.wav=Aw, you’re makin’ me as shy as a hooker in confession! I’m not a hooker, though. Don’t go spreading that around.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_11.wav=I’ll be able to rebuild the Underdome in no time!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_12.wav=You remind me of my last boyfriend. Think you met him -- name of Jack. Real charmer, at first. Always opening doors for me, telling me I’m beautiful, shooting anyone in the face if they looked at me sideways. Course, then he got clingy and I dropped him like a bad habit...which as it turns out, wasn’t the best idea. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_13.wav=One step closer to rebuilding the Underdome. Jack didn’t take it too well when I kicked him to the curb. Way he figured it, if he couldn’t have the thing he loved, neither could I -- he sent his goons to burn the Underdome to the ground.  I think he's planning to rebuild it in his own image, but he's missing the stuff that made it great -- the flash, the pizzazz, the personality. And his tits aren’t as nice.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_14.wav=They say money can’t buy you love, but it’s a damned good replacement. Though, Mordecai might disagree with that. Poor guy -- I offered him a rakk hive’s worth of guns and cash for winning the top spot in my underdome, but he never wanted any of it. If I had a nickel for every time he asked me to run away with him...well, I wouldn’t need a tip jar, that’s for sure.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_15.wav=Thanks for the tips, sugar. I think it's time your generosity was…rewarded.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_16.wav=I tell ya, sugar -- the resistance was desperate for someone like you. Roland's a real sweetheart, but everybody knows this city's just a skagleap away from getting torn apart by Hyperion or the bandits. We all thought we were safe in New Haven a few years back, but that...that didn't turn out so well. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_17.wav=I appreciate it, darling -- business hasn't been so hot since Hyperion rolled into town. They talk big about "cleaning up the wasteland" and "civilizing Pandora," but it really just comes down to two things: money, and control. And Hyperion wants both.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_18.wav=You met Ellie yet? Lovely girl. Hates my guts. I tried to explain to her -- there's no harm in putting just a little effort into your appearance. A little rouge here, some dieting there -- reasonable requests, I thought, but a few years of that were enough to make her move out to the Dust. Said something about making her own way, that she didn't need Scooter or I. (sighing) Kids, you know?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_19.wav=Thanks. This place ain't doing great, but it's still doing better than most -- nothing dulls the pain of losing a war quite like a strong glass of rakk-ale.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_20.wav=Appreciated, sugar. That reminds me of something Jimbo Hodunk told me right before me and the kids left his disgusting bandit clan forever. He said, "(frontier gibberish)". I'll never forget that.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_21.wav=You haven't met the Hodunks yet, have you? Bastards, every one of 'em. They think just cause you're born into their stupid clan, you have to follow their rules, date who they tell you to date, murder who they tell you to murder, and -- yeugh. (gradually going back into her natural redneck accent) Good lord, I am so glad the kids and I left that stupid clan forever-- oh god, did I go back into the accent? Oh no. Oh no. Oh crap. Don't tell anybody.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_22.wav=There was a time when I'd be out there on the frontlines, fighting Jack's troops alongside you. Course, that was four kids and god knows how many husbands ago -- my reflexes aren't exactly what they used to be.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_FavGun_01.wav=How generous of you. Here -- this is my favorite gun. You'll understand when you use it.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Moxxi_React_Tip_Jar_NotFavGun_01.wav=Here -- this isn't my favorite gun, but you might get some use out of it.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Steal_Money_02.wav=Really? You're stealing from a helpless widow? Really?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Steal_Money_03.wav=(sarcastically) It's fine. I didn't need to eat this month.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Steal_Money_04.wav=Yeah, I'm sure you needed that more than I did.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Steal_Money_05.wav=It took me a week to earn that! COME ON!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Steal_Money_06.wav=(unenthusiastically) No. Don't. Stop.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Steal_Money_07.wav=Far as home robberies go, I guess that could have been worse.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Steal_Money_08.wav=Come on.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Steal_Money_09.wav=Please, come in. Take all my money.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Steal_Money_10.wav=Um…that was mine.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Steal_Money_11.wav=(Heavy sigh.) 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_Interact_Tip_01.wav=That was kind of my life's savings, but okay.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Activate_01.wav=Yeah?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Activate_02.wav=I'd tell you to leave, but that's a pretty large gun.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Activate_03.wav=Please. Come on in.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Activate_04.wav=I hear Jack's killing Vault Hunters. Is that true?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Activate_05.wav=Trespassing is fun, isn't it?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Activate_06.wav= Make yourself at home, in my house that you entered without permission.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Activate_07.wav=Hi. Go ahead and rob me if you're gonna.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Activate_08.wav=I really need to lock that door.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Activate_09.wav=Hello. You're very intimidating.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Activate_10.wav=Another vault hunter? Hope you live.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Mumble_01.wav=I wonder what it's like to have a husband who's not dead.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Mumble_02.wav=This is as good as it gets, isn't it?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Mumble_03.wav=Least I'm not dead.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Mumble_04.wav=Could be worse. Least I'm not in New Haven.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Mumble_05.wav=I really thought Jack coulda made this planet better. Shows what I know.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Mumble_06.wav=(coughing) Gonna get the skull-shivers at this rate.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Mumble_07.wav=Great. I'm blind. (Pause.) Oh, good, it passed.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Mumble_08.wav=Who's there? I don't have any Eridium!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Mumble_09.wav=Alien ruins? Bunch of crap. No such thing.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_MrsMeer_NPC_Mumble_10.wav=(Sigh)
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Activate_01.wav=If you do not act, this world shall burn.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Activate_02.wav=This world relies on you.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Activate_03.wav=You play the most important role in the events to come. Try not to die.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Activate_04.wav=This world will die if you do not defend it.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Activate_05.wav=The other Vault Hunters were but pawns. Today, you are the one who will set us free.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Activate_06.wav=Brick, Mordecai, Roland and Lilith were powerful -- but they were nothing compared to what you shall be.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Activate_07.wav=You hold the fate of Pandora in your hands. And a fairly large gun, by the look of it. But also fate. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Activate_08.wav=This world needs Vault Hunters.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Activate_09.wav=Don't die. This planet has plans for you.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Activate_10.wav=You are the only one who can defeat Jack.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Mumble_01.wav=Jack will bathe this planet in fire.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Mumble_02.wav=The sky over Pandora will fall.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Mumble_03.wav=The end is coming.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Mumble_04.wav=The vaults will tear this planet asunder.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Mumble_05.wav=If the vault hunter cannot stop Jack, Pandora will end.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Mumble_06.wav=Without the vault hunter's intervention, Jack will ravage this planet.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Mumble_07.wav=This is a world on the brink of destruction. Or something.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Mumble_08.wav=Ashes. All will be ashes.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Mumble_09.wav=I can smell the brimstone already.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Mumble_10.wav=This will all end.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Perch_HandHip_01.wav=It'll all be gone one day.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Perch_HandHip_02.wav=Figures.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Perch_LeanRail_01.wav=Better rest.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_Perch_LeanRail_02.wav=(sigh)

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_NighGuy_NPC_RolandDead_01.wav=I knew one of our number would fall in battle, but…I didn't want it to be Roland. He was -- a decent man.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Activate_01.wav=You…are quite intimidating.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Activate_02.wav=I shan't cross you, if I can help it! Haha!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Activate_03.wav=Killed any skags lately? I should hope so.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Activate_04.wav=Feeling well?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Activate_05.wav=Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Activate_06.wav=Hi! Hello!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Activate_07.wav=And how are you?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Activate_08.wav=You're not working with that Marcus fellow, are you? 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Activate_09.wav=Ssssssooooooooooooooooooo…Moxxi said anything about me?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Activate_10.wav=You smell very nice.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Mumble_01.wav=Scuse me.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Mumble_03.wav=Hello!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Mumble_04.wav=What…is that smell?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Mumble_05.wav=Oh, look -- a vault hunter!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Mumble_06.wav=Oh damn, I've forgotten something.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Mumble_07.wav=What was I doing, again?
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Mumble_08.wav=Bloody Doctor Zed. Total quack.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Mumble_09.wav=Roland's such a nice lad.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Mumble_10.wav=Feeling a bit peckish.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Perch_BangDoor_01.wav=Come out, I demand it!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Perch_BangDoor_02.wav=I shall not be ignored!
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Perch_HandHip_01.wav=Makes you think.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Perch_HandHip_02.wav=I really am far from home.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Perch_LeanRail_01.wav=How dull.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Perch_LeanRail_02.wav=Utterly tiresome.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Perch_LeanWall_01.wav=Best take a break.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Perch_LeanWall_02.wav=(mild sigh of relief)
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Perch_Sit_01.wav=My feet hurt like the dickens.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Noriko_NPC_Perch_Sit_02.wav=Could use a rest.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_PatriciaTannis_Quest_NPC_Reminder_01.wav=Oh hello, vault hunter. If you wouldn't mind taking a break from smashing creatures into goopy collections of bone marrow and sadness, I have a job for you back in Sanctuary. (sheepish, rushed) This isn't a date.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_PatriciaTannis_Quest_UI_Idle_04.wav=Well, I have things to do if you wouldn't mind… removing your face from the vicinity of my face. Like in a nowish way.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_PatriciaTannis_Quest_UI_Idle_05.wav=So many calculations left to do. So much research left to explore. So many inanimate objects left to best in sexual combat. What to do…
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_PatriciaTannis_Quest_UI_Idle_06.wav=Sometimes I put my hand on the shoulder of the nearest passer-by, which for the record aggrivates my vomit reflex, and I say "good job, Lord Garflax of the Tardik system values your sacrifice," to mess with them. (beat) And then I burn an effigy to Lord Garflax. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_PatriciaTannis_Quest_UI_Idle_07.wav=There's too much left to do. If we're going to stop Jack we're going to need a hell of a lot more Porcheen Combat Fruits.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_PatriciaTannis_Quest_UI_Idle_08.wav=My lower lip tastes like me, but my upper lip tastes like Tandoran lip Destroyers, which are a local delicacy if you don't mind your lips being ripped from your face. 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_PatriciaTannis_Quest_UI_Idle_09.wav=Can I help you? I have things to do, mouth-breather
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_PatriciaTannis_Quest_UI_Idle_10.wav=Is there something you still require? I'm quite tired and want to lay down with a ceiling chair if you wouldn't mind disappearing.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_PatriciaTannis_Radio_Commercial_variation_01.wav=This is Patricia Tannis.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Sheriff_Lynchwood_Speaker_04.wav=I'd like to remind you folks not to cut down anyone hangin' from my gallows. They're there as a warning to the rest of you, and, well, as entertainment. So the next time you see someone gaspin' for air from a coil of rope, you just let 'em swing in the breeze.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Sheriff_Lynchwood_Speaker_05.wav=A couple of you have learned that Handsome Jack's my boyfriend. If you're worried that means I'm just a pretty face who got this town as an anniversary gift, well – you know where to find me.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Sheriff_Lynchwood_Speaker_07.wav=This is the Sheriff. If you're here, that means one of two things: you're looking for a nice, quiet life...or I'm gonna watch you kick out your last hangin' from one of my gallows. Given how boring things can get around here, I do hope it's the latter. Welcome to Lynchwood.
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Sheriff_Lynchwood_Speaker_08.wav=You've got me to thank that you're living in a town called Lynchwood, everybody. You know what Jack wanted to call this place? New New Haven. I love the guy, but he doesn't exactly have a way with words.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Tannis_Quest_UI_Idle_03.wav=Have you visited the well-endowed woman's public house? The patrons' raucous laughter and physical violence often keep me up at night. Perhaps one day I will visit the bar, and take notes from a distance.

Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Tediore_Radio_01.wav=Hiiii! The Tediore corporation would like to tell you that for the cost of one Hyperion pistol, you could own three Tediore submachine guns -- that's nearly three times as many! Who needs fancy elemental tech or high damage when you can reload faster than you can blink? Order now, and you'll receive the Tediore Family Pack - three shotguns, four assault rifles, and a teeny-tiny rocket launcher for the kids. Makes a great gift! 
Voices\English(US)\VOCT_Tediore_Radio_02.wav=Mrs. Tediore here. I’m not going to tell you that spending exorbitant amounts of money on weapons with silly features like “elemental tech” or “increased damage” will break the bank, leaving you so poor you’re incapable of buying food, shelter, or medicine when you need it most, to the point where your desire for excessive personal protection ironically results in your own death. I’d never say that! I’m simply here to suggest that Tediore’s weapons are so cheap, that you could easily buy an entire arsenal and still have enough money left over to, say, buy a car! Buy a house! Not starve to death! Tediore -- because breaking your enemies shouldn’t break the bank.
