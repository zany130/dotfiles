# this folder will be traversed recursively
# additionally, inside this folder you can create a file called `load_order.txt` and

# each line should be the relative path of the target dll, relative to the injection folder

#DllsToInjectFolder=extra_dlls

[Persistence]
# 0 = turned off
# 1 = loader will spawn the exe and keep hanging in the background until you press "OK"
# 2 = loader will NOT spawn exe, it will just setup the required environemnt and keep hanging in the background
#     you have to run the Exe manually, and finally press "OK" when you've finished playing
#     you have to rename the loader to "steam.exe"
#     it is advised to run the loader as admin in this mode
