COPYPREFIX=1 option added. What this does:\r\n\r\nBy default steam stores the wine prefixes in the steam library where the game is installed under SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/ as well as shader cache files in shadercache/. When 'Steam Deck' session aka gamescope session is used, the -steamdeck option is appended to steam. This causes the default path for prefix compatdata and shadercache to change to the default steam install location ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata (or shadercache). This can be problematic if you are say for example switching from normal desktop steam to steamdeck. Or for example if you have a portable hard drive or SD card you keep your games on to use between the two. If you did something like say install mods for a game or played a game that doesnt work with cloud saves on the desktop, the prefix would not get used when you move the drive over from the desktop to steamdeck. Instead steamdeck would try to make a new one. The same goes in reverse for if you play games on the steam deck and try to move the game drive or sd card to a desktop.\r\n\r\nWhat COPYPREFIX=1 DOES is if -steamdeck is applied it will check if a prefix exists on the game partition/drive. If it does, it will then WIPE the steamdeck prefix, and replace it with the one from the game partition/drive. .  It does this with shader cache as well. This way steam will pick up your mods/saves that you had on your desktop or other PC you used the drive on before. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if -steamdeck is NOT applied -- it works in reverse. It will  try to wipe the prefix on the game partition, and replace it with the one in steamdeck's default location.  It does this with shader cache as well. A good use case for the reverse of the desktop -- say you've put in a ton of hours on a game with saves that don't work with steam cloud saving -- or have a bunch of mods you've applied on a game on your steam deck -- then you want to migrate to your desktop. In this case, put steam in desktop mode. Close steam then re-open it from the terminal using the steam command so that -steamdeck is NOT applied, then you can use COPYPREFIX to copy the steamdeck prefix to your game's partition/drive.\r\n\r\nAgain to clarify usage scenarios:\r\n\r\n1.\r\nSteam launched in deck mode (-steamdeck applied) or from terminal with -steamdeck = copy FROM game partition prefix TO steamdeck prefix\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n2. \r\nSteam launched from desktop shortcut or terminal without -steamdeck -- copy FROM steamdeck prefix TO game partition prefix.\r\n\r\nHow to use:\r\n\r\nPut `COPYPREFIX=1 %command%` in the game launch options. When you run the game it will copy the prefix. You can remove the option afterwards.\r\n\r\nPlease be careful when using this, it wipes the destination prefix contents before copying.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther updates:\r\n-wine updated to latest bleeding edge\r\n-dxvk updated to latest git\r\n-vkd3d-proton updated to latest git\r\n-imported upstream proton changes\r\n-imported upstream steamclient changes\r\n\r\nProtonfixes:\r\n- [Add XAudio 2.9 verb for Space Engineers](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-protonfixes/commit/91d9db32f4a91f250075f86a54312e44bee29ca9)\r\n- [Update Cease to Breathe fix](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-protonfixes/commit/091aecf2b6210f8612a26091baddc053e56f70a5)\r\n- [fix audio for in-game videos](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-protonfixes/commit/e38e09e36cbbca3a64678bf77b2f65fc478c7e0f) YOU and ME and HER: A Love Story\r\n- [Game fix for Fallout 76](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-protonfixes/commit/38bce313b9814325ee44bca9f39a6f816a1ca0e9) -- this one needs a double check.

Game should be playable now with videos. Mouse pointer issue is also fixed.\r\n- Upside down videos fixed in Endless Space 2 and some players in VRChat:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/pull/157\r\n\r\nNote: This does not fix -all- upside down videos, just some.\r\n\r\n- Guild Wars 2 Arcdps crash fix patch added from https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51683\r\n- protonfix added for Spiderman: Shattered Dimensions (thanks Iglu47!)\r\n- protonfix for Conan Exiles has been modified to install Proton BattlEye Runtime automatically if not done yet and will launch with -BattlEye option. Tested shortly and was able to join two BattlEye enabled servers without issue.\r\n- Phantasy Star Online 2 file search stutter workaround patch added (Thanks GoLD-ReaVeR!). \r\n\r\nFSR UPDATES\r\n----------------------\r\nThe Halo Infinite patches basically broke the fullscreen hack -if- WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR is not enabled. \r\n\r\nIf it IS enabled, fullscreen hack works fine. \r\n\r\nSO moving forward the WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR IS ENABLED FOR ALL GAMES BY DEFAULT.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean?\r\n\r\n1) If you are not upscaling your game (you play at your native screen resolution) this does not affect you. FSR is only used when upscaling.\r\n\r\n2) By default, the \"balanced\" resolution option for FSR is added to the resolution list if a mode is not specified. If you want a different mode, use WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_MODE=<your mode>\r\n\r\nModes as mentioned are : ultra, quality, balanced, performance. You cannot combine multiple modes as this causes some in-game resolution lists to break.\r\n\r\n3) If your system is a hamster on it's last leg and you upscale without using FSR because of the overhead involved by using FSR -- you'll need to use regular proton. \r\n\r\nWith FSR disabled, the fullscreen hack would not allow me to change aspect ratios or resolutions outside my monitor's. You may have better luck but this will not be supported. The majority of Proton-GE users rely on FSR upscaling compared to those who do not use FSR for upscaling, and as I mentioned it does not affect those who are not upscaling.\r\n\r\n4) You can disable FSR with `WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=0`, however for the majority of people this is not needed. Again, as mentioned FSR being enabled by default does NOT affect anyone who is -not- upscaling.\r\n\r\nAnd just to once more go over basic usage:\r\n\r\n`WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_MODE=ultra %command%`\r\n> set in-game to fullscreen with the new 'ultra' resolution size from the resolution list. This will differ depending on your screen aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n`WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_CUSTOM_MODE=widthxheight %command%`\r\nex.\r\n`WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_CUSTOM_MODE=1234x4321 %command%`\r\n> set in-game to fullscreen with the new custom resolution size from the resolution list. This would add 1234x4321 to the in-game resolution list.\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n\r\n- Borderless Fullscreen mode with fullscreen hack is broken in some games (Apex Legends) -- ie it just creates a borderless window at the resolution you set instead of adding black bar fillers. This is an issue with Valve's upstream Proton Experimental bleeding edge build, and is not caused by any FSR patches.\r\n\r\n- MangoHud currently crashes Apex Legends -if- exec= lines are in the configuration:\r\nhttps://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/issues/809\r\n\r\nI've submitted a workaround on the Goverlay side that should allow it to work again with Goverlay's options except the custom script option:\r\nhttps://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/pull/12\r\n\r\nYou'll probably want that patch in order to display distro/version/kernel/session info without Apex crashing. (I've already released a patched Goverlay version for Nobara users, you should get it in your system package updates)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/73269174","id":73269174,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"GE-Proton7-28 Released","tag_name":"GE-Proton7-28","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/73205080","id":73205080,"name":"GE-Proton7-28.sha512sum","content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":151,"download_count":24277,"created_at":"2022-07-31T01:06:50Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T01:06:51Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/GE-Proton7-28/GE-Proton7-28.sha512sum"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/73205081","id":73205081,"name":"GE-Proton7-28.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":416168736,"download_count":39170,"created_at":"2022-07-31T01:06:51Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T01:08:26Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/GE-Proton7-28/GE-Proton7-28.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2022-07-31T01:00:52Z","published_at":"2022-07-31T01:08:46Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/GE-Proton7-28","body":"- Halo infinite wine video playback patches disabled -- they break too many games.

There are several reasons this was done, which are explained in detail in the post above.\r\n\r\nI needed a way to express that the base is all Proton7 and to reset the minor versions. Additionally, from previous discussions I've had with some other devs on official proton, they requested that I modify the name so that the GE versions were easier to differentiate, which is why the GE prefix has been moved to the front of the name.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly has changed?\r\n\r\n- WINE upstream repo has been changed to Proton experimental bleeding edge.\r\n- Wine-staging is no longer used, but we keep it within the repository in case it is discovered that patches are needed from it later on.\r\n\r\nWhat has remained the same from previous Proton-GE builds?\r\n\r\n- mfplat implementation and continued work\r\n- gstreamer and ffmpeg implementation\r\n- protonfixes implementation and continued work\r\n- Various game patches which are not included in either upstream wine or proton and continuation to add such patches\r\n- dxvk-git and adding new patches or pending PRs as they become available\r\n- dxvk is still patched with async\r\n- vkd3d-proton-git and adding new patches or pending PRs as they become available\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's actually fixed in this release compared to the last one?\r\n\r\n- Elden Ring EAC now works\r\n- The crash in various Unity games is resolved\r\n- Since we are now using proton's bleeding-edge experimental, we now have -all- of the controller and gamescope related patches. So if something is broken there -- it's an upstream proton bug.\r\n- Fixed doubled size issue caused by both dist folder and dist tarball being included. The dist tarball is not necessary and has been removed, returning the build to its original size instead of double.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/60526269","id":60526269,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"Proton-7.3-GE-1 Released","tag_name":"7.3-GE-1","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/57959178","id":57959178,"name":"Proton-7.3-GE-1.sha512sum","content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":153,"download_count":19924,"created_at":"2022-02-26T03:04:33Z","updated_at":"2022-02-26T03:04:34Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/7.3-GE-1/Proton-7.3-GE-1.sha512sum"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/57959063","id":57959063,"name":"Proton-7.3-GE-1.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":895628630,"download_count":26841,"created_at":"2022-02-26T03:01:11Z","updated_at":"2022-02-26T03:04:33Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/7.3-GE-1/Proton-7.3-GE-1.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2022-02-26T02:49:55Z","published_at":"2022-02-26T03:04:38Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/7.3-GE-1","body":"WINE:\r\n- imported rebased fullscreen hack from proton 7.0\r\n- imported SDL patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported gamepad patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported racing wheel/ffb patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported several misc. game fixes/patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported gamescope patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported updated mfplat patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported rebased audio patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported rebased mouse focus patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported keyboard translation patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported rebased font patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported EAC patches from proton 7.0\r\n- imported network connectivity patches from proton 7.0\r\n- Cities XXL fix added (Thanks Alistair Leslie-Hughes)\r\n- updated wine + staging to git\r\n\r\nPROTON:\r\n- imported build system changes from proton 7.0\r\n- updated gstreamer to 1.18.6\r\n- updated dxvk to git\r\n- updated vkd3d-proton to git\r\n- updated dxvk-nvapi to git\r\n- removed FAudio from build (it's part of WINE now and works with WMA decoding)\r\n- removed jxrlib from build (it's part of WINE now)\r\n\r\nPROTONFIXES:\r\n- Added EAC disable workaround to allow Gears5 single-player to work (Thanks ga2mer)\r\n- Added EAC disable workaround to allow Jump Force single-player to work (Thanks Nej on discord)\r\n- Added EAC disable workaround to allow Dragonball Fighter Z single-player to work (Thanks Nej on discord)\r\n- Added EAC disable workaround to allow Elden Ring single-player to work\r\n- Added fix for Civ IV: Colonization (Thanks jo-oe)\r\n- Added fix for Heavy Rain (Thanks Sterophonick)\r\n- Added fix for Putt Putt PBS (Thanks Sterophonick)\r\n- Removed Baldur's Gate 3 Launcher disable -- it works now.

Currently proton's SDL gamepad patches have been disabled in favor of WINE upstream's HID implementation. I did my usual test with Guilty Gear Strive and everything seems to appear OK. The test is done in the dojo, with one xbox controller and one ps5 controller -- both controllers showed up fully functional for player 1 and 2, and proper button mappings and button images showed and worked. \r\n\r\nAnother note regarding GG Strive in particular with the testing:\r\n\r\n    # note you have to take some funky steps for 2 player to work in training mode (not linux specific):\r\n    # https://playgame.tips/how-to-play-with-a-friend-in-training\r\n\r\nI have not tested any force feedback games and am not sure if patches for that have been added. Unfortunately re-enabling the SDL patches will require a -massive- list of reverts, so for the time being as mentioned, the default HID joystick impementation is being used and proton's SDL patches disabled, at least until proton upstream rebases.\r\n\r\n(2) Deathloop seems to very much dislike alt+tabbing out. For me it would freeze the game. Other than that it appeared to be playable."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/48623134","id":48623134,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"Proton-6.16-GE-1 released","tag_name":"6.16-GE-1","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/43530478","id":43530478,"name":"Proton-6.16-GE-1.sha512sum","content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":154,"download_count":10166,"created_at":"2021-08-29T01:40:50Z","updated_at":"2021-08-29T01:40:50Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.16-GE-1/Proton-6.16-GE-1.sha512sum"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/43530479","id":43530479,"name":"Proton-6.16-GE-1.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":431742014,"download_count":30556,"created_at":"2021-08-29T01:40:50Z","updated_at":"2021-08-29T01:40:57Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.16-GE-1/Proton-6.16-GE-1.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2021-08-29T00:10:31Z","published_at":"2021-08-29T01:41:13Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/6.16-GE-1","body":"Nothing too crazy in this release, mainly just updating to 6.16 and other relevant submodules to latest git\r\n\r\n- FSR default sharpness changed from 5 to 2 per AMD recommendations (page 25): https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR/blob/master/docs/FidelityFX-FSR-Overview-Integration.pdf\r\n- protonfixes added to fix black screen in Gothic 1 and 2 -- thanks manueliglesiasgarcia!\r\n- protonfixes added to enable dxvk async for Final Fantaxy XIII and Tomb Raider 2013 -- thanks iWeaker4you!\r\n- Wine + Wine-staging updated to 6.16\r\n- FAudio updated to git\r\n- DXVK updated to git\r\n- VKD3D updated to git\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/47952348","id":47952348,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"Proton-6.15-GE-2 released","tag_name":"6.15-GE-2","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/42614958","id":42614958,"name":"Proton-6.15-GE-2.sha512sum","content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":154,"download_count":4238,"created_at":"2021-08-17T06:31:51Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T06:31:51Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.15-GE-2/Proton-6.15-GE-2.sha512sum"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/42614961","id":42614961,"name":"Proton-6.15-GE-2.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":432747431,"download_count":17583,"created_at":"2021-08-17T06:31:51Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T06:31:59Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.15-GE-2/Proton-6.15-GE-2.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2021-08-17T06:10:07Z","published_at":"2021-08-17T06:34:53Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/6.15-GE-2","body":"-Fixed regression that broke TemTem\r\n-Fixed regression(s) that broke Tokyo Xanadu eX+\r\n-Added workaround that skips CoD Black Ops III videos (allows game to be playable)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/47885946","id":47885946,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"Proton-6.15-GE-1 released","tag_name":"6.15-GE-1","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/42534528","id":42534528,"name":"Proton-6.15-GE-1.sha512sum","content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":154,"download_count":1185,"created_at":"2021-08-16T05:30:10Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T05:30:10Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.15-GE-1/Proton-6.15-GE-1.sha512sum"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/42534529","id":42534529,"name":"Proton-6.15-GE-1.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":432734862,"download_count":3758,"created_at":"2021-08-16T05:30:10Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T05:30:18Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.15-GE-1/Proton-6.15-GE-1.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2021-08-16T05:26:05Z","published_at":"2021-08-16T06:01:24Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/6.15-GE-1","body":"NOTE: Due to the symlink updates for steam cloud saves, you will want to remove your old game prefixes so that they are properly regenerated with new symlinks. Your games may not launch otherwise:\r\n\r\nProton Game and Prefix Launch troubleshooting:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxWJ1xvowMk\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n- Import proper steam cloud save fixes from upstream proton\r\n- Import Project Cars III window focus fixes from upstream proton\r\n- Import Tokyo Xanadu Xe+ ASF fixes from upstream proton\r\n- Import Guilty Gear Strive cloud save path fixes from upstream proton\r\n- Import multiple font fixes from upstream proton\r\n- Fixed crash with Hitman 2\r\n- Added workaround for FFXIV broken login button\r\n   Details:\r\n      There are two executables shipped with FFXIV for the launcher -- ffxivboot.exe and ffxivboot64.exe.\r\n      Each one has a 'new' launcher mode and an 'old' launcher mode. The 'old' launcher mode is what we use to login on linux,\r\n      however it uses mshtml and jscript by default, which break the 'Log In' button.\r\n      The normal way to usually get around this is to just press enter after you input your password,\r\n      but that can be annoying when you accidentally hit the button.\r\n\r\n      Here is where the workaround comes in. The ffxivboot.exe has a built-in function called IsTransgaming,\r\n      which tells the old launcher mode to use CEF instead of mshtml+jscript. When IsTransgaming is triggered,\r\n      CEF gets used and it fixes the log in button. ffxivboot64.exe does -not- have this. Additionally, a\r\n      patch was needed to trigger IsTransgaming. So, FFXIV has been configured to use ffxivboot.exe instead of ffxivboot64.exe,\r\n      the patch to trigger IsTransgaming has been applied, and the old launcher mode is configured to be used.\r\n      This allows the old launcher mode to be fully functional.\r\n\r\n- Added FFXIV frame timing configuration for DXVK to resolve some stuttering, noted here: https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2210\r\n- Re-added missing mfplat stub that was accidentally removed from staging's mfplat patches.

Can be enabled with VKD3D_CONFIG=upload_hvv\r\n-AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) has been patched in as the fullscreen hack's upscaling backend. Works on most games (not all, there are some caveats). For basic usage in most case only WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 is needed. The default sharpening of 5 is enough without needing modification, but can be changed with WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH=# (0-5) if wanted.\r\n\r\nDetails from pull request:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/pull/116\r\n\r\n    This is an implementation of AMD's FSR https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-superresolution/ in fshack, which allows users to chose it instead of linear/nearest filtering for upscaling. It can be enabled using WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 and a lower in game resolution than the display's native one. WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH controls the amount of sharpening (not to be confused with AMD's quality presets, those are about the input resolution), 0 is the maximum sharpness, higher values mean less sharpening. The default is 5.\r\n\r\n    Caveats:\r\n\r\n        Only works in vulkan games (dxvk and vkd3d-proton included).\r\n        Some games upscale on their own, without using fshack, when you select a lower resolution in game. FSR won't work in those.\r\n        Obviously applying FSR to the final image is not ideal, it should be applied before the UI is drawn and before some post processing effects like film grain.\r\n        AMD also recommends a negative LOD bias, which is not possible in a generic way without problems.\r\n        This is only the slow fp32 version, if accepted I might follow up with the fp16 version.\r\n\r\n-1080p, 4k, and ultrawide input quality resolutions have been added to the FSR patch. See: \r\n\r\n        https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-superresolution/#quality\r\n\r\n-Various cloud save location symlink fixes have been added:\r\n\r\n    My Documents -> Documents\r\n    Application Data -> AppData/Roaming\r\n    Local Settings/Application Data -> AppData/Local\r\n\r\n-Font fixes imported from proton upstream\r\n-DXVK updated\r\n-vkd3d updated\r\n-FAudio updated\r\n-Wine-mono updated to 6.2.2\r\n\r\n-A note on controller changes: hotplugging is still a bit wonky. If you unplug a controller then replug it, you may need to restart the game.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/45750436","id":45750436,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"Proton-6.12-GE-1","tag_name":"6.12-GE-1","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/39845958","id":39845958,"name":"Proton-6.12-GE-1.sha512sum","content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":168,"download_count":2692,"created_at":"2021-07-07T01:48:41Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T01:48:42Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.12-GE-1/Proton-6.12-GE-1.sha512sum"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/39845954","id":39845954,"name":"Proton-6.12-GE-1.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":389700793,"download_count":18340,"created_at":"2021-07-07T01:48:34Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T01:48:41Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.12-GE-1/Proton-6.12-GE-1.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2021-07-07T02:02:51Z","published_at":"2021-07-06T07:09:06Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/6.12-GE-1","body":"HOTFIX: 7/6/2021:\r\n-fix mfplat issue where some patches were not correctly applied, fixes The Outer Worlds, Power Rangers Battle for the Grid, and a few others that broke.\r\n\r\nRELEASE 7/5/2021:\r\n\r\n-Necromunda \"glowing\" fixed\r\n-Cyberpunk 2077 inventory crash fixed\r\n-Guilty Gear Strive video playback fixed\r\n-Forza Horizon 4 appears playable on Nvidia now (so far from my testing it seems to run now without issue)\r\n-Battlefield 4 multiplayer ping issue fixed -- new ping patch from upstream added https://source.winehq.org/patches/data/207990\r\n-Civilization VI now playable\r\n-RDR2 working again (turns out it worked before, it just needed -fullscreen option otherwise it refused to launch. added in protonfixes now)\r\n-Dirt 5 works\r\n-Gunfire Reborn works\r\n-Foxhole works\r\n-fixed issue where directx and/or other prefix preinstall steps would hang/fail\r\n-added fixes for star wars galactic battlegrounds saga\r\n-dxvk updated to git\r\n-vkd3d updated to git and pending 2.4 pull requests added\r\n-faudio updated"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/44184081","id":44184081,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"Proton-6.10-GE-1 Released","tag_name":"6.10-GE-1","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/38395402","id":38395402,"name":"Proton-6.10-GE-1.sha512sum","content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":168,"download_count":2809,"created_at":"2021-06-10T16:49:37Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T16:49:38Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.10-GE-1/Proton-6.10-GE-1.sha512sum"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/38395403","id":38395403,"name":"Proton-6.10-GE-1.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":388824050,"download_count":24597,"created_at":"2021-06-10T16:49:38Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T16:49:45Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.10-GE-1/Proton-6.10-GE-1.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2021-06-10T16:50:56Z","published_at":"2021-06-07T06:59:38Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/6.10-GE-1","body":"HOTFIX: 6/10/21 (2)\r\n-Woops, forgot to re-enable GTA V key input fix.

The game is very picky about fullscreen hack changes. Valve is working on a correct implementation of vulkan childwindow patches, which affect the fullscreen hack. Unfortunately they are still broken, which is why DOOM Eternal was borked. Up until now we have been using a hack to achieve this, which works reliably. In the last 6.8 build I used the new patches without realizing they still had problems. I have reverted back to the hack for now until the upstream patches are more mature. This seems to allow both P4G and DOOM to behave nicely.\r\n\r\n2) Origin is about as stable as trying to piss in the wind while drunk at 3 am. When running a new Origin game and creating the prefix, you may need to run it a few times/clear the prefix/clear your steam downloads cache. It may also crash when trying to launch the game, may take a few attempts.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/42679927","id":42679927,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"Proton-6.8-GE-1 Released","tag_name":"6.8-GE-1","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/36724368","id":36724368,"name":"Proton-6.8-GE-1.sha512sum","content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":167,"download_count":1343,"created_at":"2021-05-10T09:22:43Z","updated_at":"2021-05-10T09:22:43Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.8-GE-1/Proton-6.8-GE-1.sha512sum"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/36724369","id":36724369,"name":"Proton-6.8-GE-1.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":490782863,"download_count":7389,"created_at":"2021-05-10T09:22:43Z","updated_at":"2021-05-10T09:23:25Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.8-GE-1/Proton-6.8-GE-1.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2021-05-10T09:23:18Z","published_at":"2021-05-10T03:57:07Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/6.8-GE-1","body":"IMPORTANT NOTES:\r\n\r\n1) Due to large changes in wine 6.5+, you will need to remove old/current prefixes for any games launched with this version.

There's still some media foundation related bugs and pending fixes that Derek (mfplat patchset author) is working on, but this release should be good enough to get some new games working that weren't previously (notably MK11, Injustice 2, Need for Speed), At the end of the week wine 6.5 releases so if the media foundation patches are fully resolved by then there will likely be another release.  Here are the details on this release for now:\r\n\r\nMedia Foundation changes/currently known issues:\r\n--------\r\nWorking:\r\n-MK11 cutscenes fully working, video+audio in cutscenes works, has slight audio desync. Crypt also works.\r\n-Injustice 2 cutscenes fully working, video+audio in cutscenes works, has slight audio desync\r\n\r\nBroken:\r\n-DmC 5's \"History of DMC\" video is broken again\r\n-Power Rangers Battle for the Grid Story videos broken\r\n-Seven: Days Long Gone Humble Bundle logo video will hang if intros are not skipped\r\n-Borderlands 3 Marcus intro on new game hangs (again)\r\n-RE2/RE3 WMV playback currently broken\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-As this is a new implementation of the mfplat patches, WMV support and MPEG4 Section 2 support are both missing/not added yet. It is a work in progress, and you may see bugs that were previously fixed. Please be patient as this is a work in progress.\r\n--------\r\n\r\n\r\nWine:\r\n--------\r\n-Updated wine + wine-staging to 6.4-git\r\n-Need For Speed atiadlxx fix ported from proton (Need For Speed now runs)\r\n-Crown Trick + Home Behind 2 fix ported from proton\r\n-Hades controller input fix ported from proton\r\n-DualSense/PS5 controller mapping ported from proton\r\n-Additional OpenXR patches ported from proton\r\n--------\r\n\r\n-FAudio updated to git\r\n-Wine and Wine-staging updated to git\r\n-vkd3d updated to git\r\n-dxvk updated to git and FarCry 5 texture issue worked around\r\n-Dead or Alive 5 protonfix added (thanks iglu47)\r\n-watchdogs 2 and farcry5 uplay overlay disable protonfixes added (thanks iglu47)\r\n-corefonts fixed in protonfixes (thanks iglu47)\r\n-vcrun2019_ge download url updated in protonfixes\r\n-winetricks updated in protonfixes\r\n-msiexec re-enabled in wine build (thanks fastrizwaan)\r\n\r\nAll in all, I would say the summary of this build is if you want to play MK11 or Injustice 2, this build is for you, but if you have any games that heavily relied on Media Foundation (mfplat) prior to this, chances are they may be broken in this build. Once Derek gets WMV and MP4S2 implemented along with some cleanups the next build should work nicely regarding mfplat."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/37715731","id":37715731,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"Proton-6.1-GE-2","tag_name":"6.1-GE-2","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/31778160","id":31778160,"name":"Proton-6.1-GE-2.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":336544078,"download_count":30654,"created_at":"2021-02-08T03:27:35Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T03:28:04Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.1-GE-2/Proton-6.1-GE-2.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2021-02-08T00:16:53Z","published_at":"2021-02-08T00:31:47Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/6.1-GE-2","body":"HOTFIX: 2/7/2021\r\n-removed futex2 patches, they cause warframe's launcher to freeze.\r\n\r\nDownload link updated\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nRelease notes:\r\n-------------------------\r\n-removed previous steam common redistributables fix for winetricks -- it was causing crashes on arch systems, and winetricks fixed the download urls upstream anyway.

The workaround for this was to run xboxdrv to create a fake controller. About a year ago I created a patch for steamclient that worked around this issue by checking the names of joystick devices (js0,1,2 etc) in /dev/input/.  This -sort of- worked. The reason I say sort of, is because some non-gamepad devices such as corsair mice and keyboards register themselves as joysticks. \r\n\r\nSo the trick was to check the name for anything that didn't have 'keyboard' or 'mouse' in the name. This however, did not work, as other devices such as steering wheels and flight controllers also got passed as 'gamepads'. Since steering wheels and flight controllers are not used in Warframe.. this again led to the crash. \r\n\r\nI've now edited the patch again, this time steamclient's controller interface (which causes the crash), will not load in Warframe unless the device name contains 'controller' or 'pad'. I tested this with xbox, ps4, switch, and logitech controllers, as well as off-brand controllers, both wired, bluetooth, and ms xbox wireless, all were recognized ok, and the interface did not load with my steering wheel or hotas flight stick.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this patch is to allow Warframe to run -with out- needing xboxdrv, so that it will not crash. If you experience warframe crashing after 5 minutes on the dot, please let me know, as I'd like to know more about your joystick devices in /dev/input and possibly add an exception if needed.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind this detection system only affects Warframe. Outside of Warframe controllers and other devices will act as they would normally in Valve's proton.\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nA note about Skyrim SE Script Extender (skse64):\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe patch for SKSE has been removed, per:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44893#c17\r\n\r\nThe author of SKSE admitted a bug in skse and and fixed it upstream in skse:\r\n\r\n--- quote ---\r\nI reached out to the SKSE team about this and Ian Patterson confirmed that there\r\nhad been a bug with calculating the minimum safe address and corrected it in\r\nF4SE, but somehow it was not corrected for SKSE.\r\n--- quote ---\r\n\r\nThis has since been fixed here:\r\n\r\nianpatt/skse64@4a1e121\r\n\r\nHowever a new version of SKSE has not been released yet so the fix is not in it. The fix was added Dec 28 but the current SKSE build available at https://skse.silverlock.org/ is from August.\r\n\r\nI've recompiled it and supplied it here (with sources) until the Author releases a new version:\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1I6tgvZDaSs2JPXkHdWJwuZVwzF0OSpzz/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nSeems to work for me.

This returns esync/fsync functionality, and also enables some games to run correctly that weren't running in 5.11.\r\n\r\nSo yes, this is aimed as a 'STABLE' build.\r\n-All the fixes from the 5.11 releases.\r\n-esync/fsync re-enabled\r\n-MGS: Ground Zeroes fully works\r\n-Planet Zoo fully works\r\n\r\nFrom here I've created yet another branch -- proton-ge-5-stable, which I hope to backport future fixes to, and bump up once Wine gets all of its current kinks resolved. The proton-ge-5-MF branch will continue to be the upstream git branch, with major game fixes being backported to the stable branch (hopefully).\r\n\r\nI would say for now, use this as the default 'GE' build over the 5.11 builds. \r\nhttps://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/5.9-GE-3-ST"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/28223778","id":28223778,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"Proton-5.11-GE-3-MF","tag_name":"5.11-GE-3-MF","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/22552849","id":22552849,"name":"Proton-5.11-GE-3-MF.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":406135492,"download_count":16093,"created_at":"2020-07-04T22:26:12Z","updated_at":"2020-07-04T22:28:18Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/5.11-GE-3-MF/Proton-5.11-GE-3-MF.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2020-07-03T06:57:19Z","published_at":"2020-07-04T22:31:42Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/5.11-GE-3-MF","body":"This is another stability/quality update, aiming to provide a better gameplay experience and building on top of the previous build.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n-Re-enable rawinput (seems staging had it disabled in the previous build)\r\n-Re-enable FakeDLLs and SECCOMP (seems staging had it disabled in the previous build) - needed for Doom Eternal,Detroit:BH, Origin\r\n-Re-enable HideWineExports (seems staging had it disabled in the previous build) - needed for FFXIV\r\n-Fix issue with not being able to regain focus after alt+tab in various games\r\n-Fix issue with GTA V keyboard input not working\r\n-Fix issue with rawinput not working properly within a virtual desktop\r\n-Fix issue with Warframe and SWTOR not rendering correctly in dxvk on nvidia\r\n-Added patch that allows Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb to run\r\n-Added patch that allows MGS: Ground Zeroes to run (keyboard+mouse input is currently broken, needs more work.

Protonfixes have been added to do that automatically, so those games both work with wined3d currently.\r\n-There is also some heavy work being done on ntdll in 5.10+, which cause esync and fsync patchsets to not be compatible. Due to this, I'm currently working with 5.9 and backporting specific changes necessary to retain esync and fsync compatibility.\r\n-A dxgi native override was also added in protonfixes so that Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain now works\r\n-A fix has been added for the RE3 credits crash - thanks vitorhnn!\r\n-A fix has been added for the MK11 and Injustice 2 video color issue - thanks vitorhnn!\r\n-A partial fix for websockets has been added for Sea of Thieves so that login now works, however it is currently crashing after login on 'Opening the Journal' - thanks ga2mer!\r\n-5.10 media foundation patches have been backported\r\n-Remi Bernon's free range memory allocation patches have been backported which increases performance in We Happy Few and some other games.\r\n-Proton 5.0.8 changes backported\r\n-DXVK updated\r\n-vkd3d updated\r\n-FAudio updated\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n-Fullscreen hack still disabled for the time being to retain compatiblity with MK11\r\n-Path of Exile cannot switch to vulkan renderer when using RADV, but works with AMDVLK. This is something else tied to fullscreen hack, as patching in fullscreen hack allows it to switch. RADV currently has a lot of graphical glitches with PoE anyway, so for the time being AMDVLK is the better option to use.\r\n-Soul Calibur VI still hangs at intro due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation\r\n-Injustice 2 and MK11 cut scene audio is missing due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation\r\n-Borderlands 3 Marcus intro on new game audio is distorted due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation, but is skippable.\r\n-Seven still only plays intro audio, no video, and crashes after starting new game due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation.\r\n-libffi6 is still needed for some rolling release distros such as arch\r\n-As mentioned, due to work being done with wined3d, dxgi is in an odd state. If a game works in proton, but does not work in proton-ge, try adding `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=dxgi=n %command%` to the options. If it works, let me know and I can add a protonfixes override for it.\r\n\r\nCurrently I would say this should be ok to use for most games except Soul Calibur VI and Seven"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/26972273","id":26972273,"draft":false,"prerelease":true,"name":"Proton-5.9-GE-1-NR","tag_name":"5.9-GE-1-NR","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/21126321","id":21126321,"name":"Proton-5.9-GE-1-MF.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":400846396,"download_count":4508,"created_at":"2020-05-28T02:55:54Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T03:09:56Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/5.9-GE-1-NR/Proton-5.9-GE-1-MF.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2020-05-28T02:35:58Z","published_at":"2020-05-28T03:11:42Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/5.9-GE-1-NR","body":"Hi all. This pre-release has yet more media foundation work added. I'm tagging it as a pre-release because I've had to disable some things in order for  a few new games to work.\r\n\r\n-Fullscreen hack was found to be the cause of Mortal Kombat 11 not working. This also requires a few other patches to be disabled such as some additional vulkan patches and raw input, as well as the Sekiro patch. Fullscreen hack used to work with this game, so this is just a temporary disable until I can figure out what in the patchset is causing MK11 to not work.\r\n-Spyro audio is fully working now\r\n-BL3 Markus intro has audio issues still but is skippable\r\n-Soul Calibur VI freezes at the intro screen currently due to an issue with SAR audio. \r\n-Seven actually launches now. Audio for intro movie plays but shows black screen. New game results in crash, again due to SAR audio.\r\n-PC Building Simulator no longer freezes when running 3dmark on low settings. It just skips the video.\r\n\r\nThis is -very- much a pre-release specifically for MK11. With MK11's new expansion just released I wanted to get this out there because it not only allows MK11 to run with gamepad support, but also Injustice 2. \r\n\r\nI have not tested, but from other sources I'm informed MK11's online mode still does -not- currently work. \r\n\r\nI did not test online modes, But offline modes in both games did work with gamepad support.\r\n![Screenshot_20200527_211055](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11287837/83094297-9f683c80-a05e-11ea-81c8-ba08eff13b6f.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20200527_200928](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11287837/83093452-b6a62a80-a05c-11ea-9594-5a93a1e156ef.png)\r\n\r\nAs of right now, the most stable version is still 5.8-GE-2-MF.

On the bright side, a lot of the media foundation work that has been done and is  currently in alpha testing, is getting to a good working state. \r\n\r\nMany of the media foundation games don't work to begin with in the first place in proton, or if they do, they work in normal proton due to the previously used media foundation hacks to disable it. These hacks conflict with upstream and no longer work as mentioned, without reverting multiple commits.\r\n\r\nBased on this moving forward my builds will include the media foundation patches. If you come across a game that works in normal proton, but does not work in my build, chances are it has a media foundation issue.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, I do feel this build is quite stable, and has had a lot of fixes implemented which get many previously non-working games into a working state, as well as fixing quite a few bugs between 5.6 and 5.7.\r\n\r\nUpdate: \r\n\r\nI forgot to also mention I've added an updated version of the dxvk async patch which allows async pipelines to work with the state cache (previous version did not). Again, use at your own risk. As far as I'm aware, this is safe to use on Path of Exile and Warframe. \r\n\r\nFor those unaware - the async patch is a feature that was in DXVK, but was removed because around the same time, people started receiving bans in overwatch. Since async came out around the same time, it was blamed and thus removed from dxvk, however in some games it provides a significant performance increase. This is why I reiterate -- use at your own risk. It can be enabled with DXVK_ASYNC=1 %command% in the steam game launch options.\r\n\r\nOverall fixes:\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n-Fix for https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/2929 added, fixes crash in Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, Nier: Automata\r\n-GTA IV should be fully playable now, patches imported from upstream proton\r\n-Street Fighter V should be fully playable now, patches imported from upstream proton\r\n-HideWineExports=Y registration added for FFXIV, fixes license issue\r\n-Homeworld Remastered Collection should be playable without custom launcher necessary\r\n-Updated steep patch for wine 5.8\r\n-fixed proton controller patch issues -- should now have full proton controller patchset and functionality to match upstream proton\r\n-patch added that fixes overwatch breakage in 5.7\r\n-patch added that fixes star citizen breakage in 5.7\r\n-patch added that fixes Path of Exile flicker in 5.7\r\n-FFXV patch is now working again, game should be playable\r\n-Monster Hunter World patches added which enable DX12 mode with vkd3d\r\n-DXVK async patch updated and re-added.

While they may contain a lot of fixes, some things may also be broken that normally are not.\r\n\r\nSpecifically in this regard - proton normally disables 'mfplay' which allows media foundation movies in many games (WMV and MP4) to just be skipped automatically. Since we enable this without full functionality, some games, such as Spyro or MHW, may hang when a movie tries to play.  \r\n\r\nIf you wish to re-disable media foundation to use this version with your other games, you can use `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=mfplay=n %command%` in the game's launch options.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/25205057","id":25205057,"draft":false,"prerelease":true,"name":"Proton-5.5-GE-1","tag_name":"5.5-GE-1","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/assets/19391349","id":19391349,"name":"Proton-5.5-GE-1.tar.gz","content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":447568013,"download_count":5905,"created_at":"2020-04-05T00:22:54Z","updated_at":"2020-04-05T00:51:13Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/5.5-GE-1/Proton-5.5-GE-1.tar.gz"}],"created_at":"2020-04-05T00:17:37Z","published_at":"2020-04-05T00:54:12Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/tarball/5.5-GE-1","body":"So I'd like to preface that  ***this is a pre-release*** that has a massive amount of media foundation/mfplat wine patches. A huge thank you goes to Derek Lesho (Guy1524: https://github.com/Guy1524/wine) as well as Nikolay Sivov and Sergio Gómez Del Real all from CodeWeavers for getting this stuff working and taking the time to help me get it working with the correct dependencies in proton. \r\n\r\nWhat this does is allows mp4 playback in MANY titles, including UE4 -and- Unity engine games. This fixes a lot (not all, but a lot) of issues surrounding media foundation/mfplat without the need for the 'mf-install' workaround that has legal issues and limitations, and is much safer for us to ship.\r\n\r\nTested fixes:\r\n-Fixed borderlands 3 lilith in-head videos and 'watch the monitor' video bug\r\n-Fixes Remnant: From the Ashes intro videos, intro menu, character menu\r\n-Fixes intro video on Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night\r\n-Fixes mp4 playback issues related to Crazy Machines 3\r\n\r\nStill broken:\r\n-Borderlands 3 intro narrative with Marcus's voice on new game does not play\r\n-Spyro is still broken\r\n-Probably some other mp4 related titles\r\n\r\nAdditional updates:\r\n-A small patch has been added that should fix sunset overdrive from crashing on launch: https://source.winehq.org/patches/data/182631\r\n-Two warframe launcher regressions have been fixed\r\n-Mouse input fix patches which were added to wine-staging for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36873\r\n-Lots of gstreamer plugin related work has been done/added in order to get media foundation stuff working. This was also cleared with aeikum and kisak from Valve personally, and deemed -ok- to include in my repository. This means it is safe to continue to link in Valve's issue trackers, unlike the 'mf-install' workaround. HURRAY!\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n-Not -all- mp4s are fixed.

I've had some hit or miss troubles getting this build to a stable point that I wanted it, but all the standard games that worked before without mfplat should work fine. This should serve as a solid base moving forward. \r\n\r\nThe mf_install verb in protonfixes has been altered. I have removed the mf plat related files and registry entries which are not publicly available directly from Microsoft. I have also removed previously released builds that contained these files. There are two reasons for me doing this:\r\n\r\n-The first, is that I wish for this project to stay within legal boundaries that allow it to be shared within Valve's proton bug trackers. The goal of my project is to help progress proton, therefore I do not wish to induce limits which would cause it to be moderated or banned from their bug tracker.\r\n\r\n-The second, is that distribution of Microsoft libraries beyond Microsoft doing so directly, is illegal. Therefore I've removed those libraries from the mf_install verb's download list, and the corresponding registry entries. The only ones which remain are the ones which are supplied by Microsoft directly and are publicly available via KB976932.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n\r\n-fixed fullscreen hack to work with downscaling such as vanilla proton\r\n-added fix for fullscreen hack that allows integer scaling: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/pull/69\r\n-patches for skyrim skyui status effect icons. icons now show up.\r\n-patches for shadow of the tomb raider with vkd3d. game now runs with vkd3d again\r\n-patches for gta v rockstar launcher and game. launcher and game now function correctly\r\n-patches for origin downloads regression fix. origin should now download games and verify existing installed games (mostly) properly.\r\n-adds stub so that star wars jedi: fallen order works - note, I have not tested the steam verson, only the origin version.\r\n-patches for mk11 added. fixes mk11 launch crash. still needs mfplat\r\n-the mk11 patch has a new envvar which is enabled only for mk11 and skyrim se: WINE_MEM_ALLOC_MOD. This patch is problematic in some other games, so it was better to set it off by default and only enable it with an envvar. I have set the envvar automatically in protonfixes for these two games.\r\n-Fix for warhammer: chaosbane hair glitch in dxvk\r\n-Fix for warlock: master of the arcane new game freeze in d9vk\r\n-rawinput patches disabled (again), as it's currently broken (again).\r\n-re-enabled commit that fixes alt-tabbing in most desktop environments: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/commit/a8675091927c01a0c28de349517c5010557f06a9. Note, This causes the XFCE panel to appear above some games.\r\n-The spinlocks portion of the fsync patch has been removed in order to improve stability\r\n-d9vk updated\r\n-dxvk updated\r\n-faudio updated\r\n-vkd3d updated\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n-mk11 has desync issue with online matches (online matches will not work).\r\n\r\nMany games require mfplat functionality that does not come with proton or normal wine. It is very likely that without these libraries, some games will not function properly.
