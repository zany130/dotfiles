For this reason, from now on, I will rather do summary status updates instead of pointing out exactly which games improved.

Old names still work to preserve backwards-compatibility but are deprecated until future 1.0.0 release.\r\n* Game configuration files are re-created and now use prefix `boxtron`. Content of some sections was moved to automatic configuration. As a consequence of these two changes, some of your games might now work faster, but your other DOSBox settings (e.g. scaler) might be set back to default.\r\n* Logs now mention `boxtron` instead of `steam-dos`\r\n* Code and documentation were updated to replace the project name.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dreamer/boxtron/releases/18678334","id":18678334,"draft":false,"prerelease":false,"name":"Configure let MI DIs for you","tag_name":"v0.4.3","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dreamer/boxtron/releases/assets/13760289","id":13760289,"name":"steam-dos.tar.xz","content_type":"application/x-xz","state":"uploaded","size":39148,"download_count":214,"created_at":"2019-07-17T15:31:20Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T15:31:21Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/dreamer/boxtron/releases/download/v0.4.3/steam-dos.tar.xz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dreamer/boxtron/releases/assets/13760293","id":13760293,"name":"steam-dos.zip","content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":51829,"download_count":10,"created_at":"2019-07-17T15:31:25Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T15:31:26Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/dreamer/boxtron/releases/download/v0.4.3/steam-dos.zip"}],"created_at":"2019-07-17T15:12:53Z","published_at":"2019-07-17T15:36:55Z","tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dreamer/boxtron/tarball/v0.4.3","body":"Join us at Discord server: https://discord.gg/8mFhUPX\r\n\r\nCheck our wiki for [compatibility reports](https://github.com/dreamer/steam-dos/wiki/Compatibility-reports) and follow [Powered by DOSBox](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35328265-Powered-by-DOSBox/) curator on Steam! :)\r\n\r\n+ Auto-detection of certain MIDI hardware setups to take precedence over starting software synthesiser; tested with Casio CTK-4200, Roland UM-ONE mk2, and Ensoniq AudioPCI.\r\n+ User can now select MIDI sequencer by name, using `midi.use_sequencer` setting or `SDOS_USE_MIDI_SEQ` environment variable.
