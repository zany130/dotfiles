# Color Themes

These files provide color themes for the installer. All themes are their dark variants.

Themes can override any variable defined in [:root](/css/_root/colors.css)

Color format is `rr, gg, bb`

The `adwaita` theme is merely a reference file, it is not actually used by the installer.
