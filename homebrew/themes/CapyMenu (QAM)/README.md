# CapyMenu for QAM

## Changelog

### v2.1

- fixed broken UI components from latest Steam client update (e.g. Notifications), probably not all components as I can't exactly do thorough testing
- fixed custom gradient wrongly registering for header and footer
- removed additional space between tabs option
- minor tweaking

- re-organized folder tree
- re-organized CSS code

### v2.0

- **cleaner/more consistent UI overhaul** (removed clutter, good amount of color corrections, new themed components)
- **removed SuchMeme's [Colored Toggles](https://deckthemes.com/themes/view?themeId=d08de13f-2ef5-4d83-8b41-bbb325b3c5e1) dependency** to allow more flexbility as it themes extra UI components (e.g. Friends badge), customization for toggles and sliders is now limited to the QAM
- ~~**implemented [Avatar Customization Suite](https://deckthemes.com/themes/view?themeId=1f9f487c-d6ab-43d0-9e51-a953f9438d9c) by Charmics** for in-game view as this theme originally injects its CSS into BPM only, **full credits to them**~~ fixed on Charmics' end, option has been removed from CapyMenu
- **added an option to customize the vertical line that separates the tabs column from the main panel**
- fixed custom colors not registering for label separators
- additional bug fixes (most notable is buggy highlighted buttons in some menus, e.g. Decky plugins, Remote Play Together section)


- ALL the CSS variables were renamed as more explicit names, also should avoid possible conflicts with other themes
- CSS code is more organized

### v1.1
- unreleased, intended for personal use, some big features ported over v2.0 release

### v1.0
- initial submission
